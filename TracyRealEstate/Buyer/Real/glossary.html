		FICO® Score - a Brief Explanation<br /><br/>
		<div id="h2">FICO® Score - a Brief Explanation</div><br /><br/>
		When you apply for a mortgage loan, you expect your lender to pull a 
		credit report and look at whether you’ve made your payments on time. 
		What you may not expect is that they seem to be more interested in your 
		FICO® score.<br /><br />

		“What’s a FICO® score?” is a common reaction.<br /><br />

		Each time your credit report is pulled, it is run through a computer 
		program with a built-in scorecard. Points are awarded or deducted based 
		on certain items such as how long you have had credit cards, whether you 
		make your payments on time, if your credit balances are near maximum, 
		and assorted other variables. When the credit report prints in your 
		lender’s office, the total score is displayed. Your score can be 
		anywhere between the high 300’s and the low 850’s.<br /><br />

		Lenders wanted to determine if there was any relationship between these 
		credit scores and whether borrowers made their payments on time, so they 
		did a study. The study showed that borrowers with scores above 680 
		almost always made their payments on time. Borrowers with scores below 
		600 seemed fairly certain to develop problems.<br /><br />

		As a result, credit scoring became a more important factor in approving 
		mortgage loans. Credit scores also made it easier to develop artificial 
		intelligence computer programs that could make a “yes” decision for 
		loans that should obviously be approved. Nowadays, a computer and not a 
		person may have actually approved your mortgage.<br /><br />

		In short, lower credit scores require a more thorough review than higher 
		scores. Often, mortgage lenders will not even consider a score below 
		600.<br /><br />

		Some of the things that affect your FICO score are:<br />
		<ul><li>Delinquencies</li>
		<li>Too many accounts opened within the last twelve months</li>
		<li>Short credit history</li>
		<li>Balances on revolving credit are near the maximum limits</li>
		<li>Public records, such as tax liens, judgments, or bankruptcies</li>
		<li>No recent credit card balances</li>
		<li>Too many recent credit inquiries</li>
		<li>Too few revolving accounts</li>
		<li>Too many revolving accounts</li></ul>
		FICO® actually stands for Fair Isaac and Company, which is the company 
		used by the Experian (formerly TRW) credit bureau to calculate credit 
		scores. Trans-Union and Equifax are two other credit bureaus who also 
		provide credit scores.<br /><br />

		FICO® Scores and Your Mortgage<br /><br />

		<div id="h5">FICO® Scores and Your Mortgage</div><br />
		Years ago, credit scoring had little to do with mortgage lending. When 
		reviewing the credit worthiness of a borrower, an underwriter would make 
		a subjective decision based on past payment history.<br /><br />

		Then things changed.<br /><br />

		Lenders studied the relationship between credit scores and mortgage 
		delinquencies. There was a definite relationship. Almost half of those 
		borrowers with FICO® scores below 550 became ninety days delinquent at 
		least once during their mortgage. On the other hand, only two out of 
		every 10,000 borrowers with FICO® scores above eight hundred became 
		delinquent.<br /><br />

		So lenders began to take a closer look at FICO® scores and this is what 
		they found out. The chart below shows the likelihood of a ninety day 
		delinquency for specific FICO® scores.<br /><br />

		
		<table><tr><th><strong>FICO&reg; Score</strong></th><td></td> <th><strong>Odds of Delinquent Account</strong></th></tr>
		<tr><td>595</td> <td></td><td>2 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>600</td> <td></td><td> 4 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>615</td> <td></td><td> 9 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>630</td> <td></td><td> 18 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>645</td> <td></td><td> 36 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>660</td> <td></td><td> 72 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>680</td> <td></td><td> 144 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>780</td> <td></td><td> 576 to 1</td></tr></table><br />

		
		If you were lending a couple hundred thousand dollars, who would you 
		want to lend it to?<br /><br />

		<div id="h4">FICO® Scores, What Affects Them, How Lenders Look At Them</div><br />
	
		Imagine a busy lending office and a loan officer has just ordered a 
		credit report. He hears the whir of the laser printer and he knows the 
		pages of the credit report are going to start spitting out in just a 
		second. There is a moment of tension in the air. He watches the pages 
		stack up in the collection tray, but he waits to pick them up until all 
		of the pages are finished printing. He waits because FICO® scores are 
		located at the end of the report. Previously, he would have probably 
		picked them up as they came off. A FICO® above 700 will evoke a smile, 
		then a grin, perhaps a shout and a “victory” style arm pump in the air. 
		A score below 600 will definitely result in a frown, a furrowed brow, 
		and concern.<br /><br />

		FICO® stands for Fair Isaac &amp; Company, and credit scores are reported by 
		each of the three major credit bureaus: TRW (Experian), Equifax, and 
		Trans-Union. The score does not come up exactly the same on each bureau 
		because each bureau places a slightly different emphasis on different 
		items. Scores range from 365 to 840.<br /><br />

		<div id="h6">Some of the things that affect your FICO® scores:</div>
		
		<ul><li>Delinquencies</li>
		<li>Too many accounts opened within the last twelve months</li>
		<li>Short credit history</li>
		<li>Balances on revolving credit are near the maximum limits</li>
		<li>Public records, such as tax liens, judgments, or bankruptcies</li>
		<li>No recent credit card balances</li>
		<li>Too many recent credit inquiries</li>
		<li>Too few revolving accounts</li>
		<li>Too many revolving accounts</li></ul>
		<div id="h7">Sounds confusing, doesn’t it?</div><br />
		
		The credit score is actually calculated using a scorecard where you 
		receive points for certain things. Creditors and lenders who view your 
		credit report do not get to see the scorecard, so they do not know 
		exactly how your score was calculated. They just see the final scores.<br /><br />

		Basic guidelines on how to view the FICO® scores vary a little from 
		lender to lender. Usually, a score above 680 will require a very basic 
		review of the entire loan package. Scores between 640 and 680 require 
		more thorough underwriting. Once a score gets below 640, an underwriter 
		will look at a loan application with a more cautious approach. Many 
		lenders will not even consider a loan with a FICO® score below 600, some 
		as high as 620.<br /><br />

		<div id="h8">FICO® Scores and Interest Rates</div><br />
		
		Credit scores can affect more than whether your loan gets approved or 
		not. They can also affect how much you pay for your loan, too. Some 
		lenders establish a base price and will reduce the points on a loan if 
		the credit score is above a certain level. For example, one major 
		national lender reduces the cost of a loan by a quarter point if the 
		FICO® score is greater than 725. If it is between 700 and 724, they will 
		reduce the cost by one-eighth of a point. A point is equal to one 
		percent of the loan amount.<br /><br />

		There are other lenders who do it in reverse. They establish their base 
		price, but instead of reducing the cost for good FICO® scores, they add 
		on costs for lower FICO® scores. The results from either method would 
		work out to be approximately the same interest rate. It is just that the 
		second way looks better when you are quoting interest rates on a rate 
		sheet or in an advertisement.<br /><br />

		<div id="h3">FICO® Scores and Mortgage Underwriting Decisions</div>
		<br />
		<div id="h9">FICO® Scores as Guidelines</div>
		<br />
		FICO® scores are only guidelines and factors other than FICO® scores 
		also affect underwriting decisions. Some examples of compensating 
		factors that will make an underwriter more lenient toward lower FICO® 
		scores can be a larger down payment, low debt-to-income ratios, an 
		excellent history of saving money, and others. There also may be a 
		reasonable explanation for items on the credit history report that 
		negatively impact your credit score.<br /><br />

		<div id="h10">They Don’t Always Make Sense</div>
		<br />
		Even so, sometimes credit scores do not seem to make any sense at all. 
		One borrower with a completely flawless credit history can have a FICO® 
		score below 600. One borrower with a foreclosure on her credit report 
		can have a FICO® above 780.<br /><br />

		<div id="h11">Portfolio &amp; Sub-Prime Lenders</div>
		<br />
		Finally, there are a few portfolio lenders who do not even look at 
		credit scoring, at least on their portfolio loans. A portfolio lender is 
		usually a savings &amp; loan institution that originates some adjustable 
		rate mortgages that they intend to keep in their own portfolio rather 
		than selling them in the secondary mortgage market. These lenders may 
		look at home loans differently. Some concentrate on the value of the 
		home. Some may concentrate more on the savings history of the borrower. 
		There are also sub-prime lenders, or “B &amp; C paper” lenders, who will 
		provide a home loan, but at a higher interest rate and cost.<br /><br />

		<div id="h12">Running Credit Reports</div>
		<br />
		One thing to remember when you are shopping for a home loan is that you 
		should not let numerous mortgage lenders run credit reports on you. Wait 
		until you have a reasonable expectation that they are the lender you are 
		going to use to obtain your home loan. Not only will you have to explain 
		any credit inquiries in the last ninety days, but also numerous 
		inquiries will lower your FICO® score by a small amount. This may not 
		matter if your FICO® is 780, but it would matter if it is 642.<br /><br />

		<div id="h13">Don’t Buy A Car Just Before Looking for a Home!</div>
		<br />
		A word of advice not directly related to FICO® scores. When people begin 
		to think about the possibility of buying a home, they often think about 
		buying other big-ticket items, such as cars. Quite often when someone 
		asks a lender to pre-qualify them for a home loan there is a brand new 
		car payment on the credit report. Often, they would have qualified in 
		their anticipated price range except that the new car payment has raised 
		their debt-to-income ratio, lowering their maximum purchase price. 
		Sometimes they have bought the car so recently that the new loan doesn’t 
		even show up on the credit report yet, but with six to eight credit 
		inquiries from car dealers and automobile finance companies it is kind 
		of obvious. Almost every time you sit down in a car dealership, it 
		generates two inquiries into your credit.<br /><br />

		<div id="h14">Credit History is Important</div>
		<br />
		Nowadays, credit scores are important if you want to get the best 
		interest rate available. Protect your FICO® score. Do not open new 
		revolving accounts needlessly. Do not fill out credit applications 
		needlessly. Do not keep your credit cards nearly maxed out. Make sure 
		you do use your credit occasionally. Always make sure every creditor has 
		their payment in their office no later than 29 days past due.<br /><br />

		And never ever be more than thirty days late on your mortgage. Ever.<br /><br />

		What&#39;s a FICO®?<br /><br />

		<div id="h15">WHAT’S A FICO®?</div>
		<div id="h16">What is a FICO® Score?</div>
		<br />
		FICO® stands for Fair Isaac &amp; Company and is the name for the most well 
		known credit scoring system, used by Experian. The credit bureau’s 
		computer evaluates a complete credit profile and assigns a score, which 
		is used to estimate credit worthiness. Each of the three bureaus 
		(Experian, Trans Union, Equifax) employs its own scoring system, so a 
		given person will usually have 3 separate scores. Someone with a higher 
		score will be viewed as a better risk than someone with a lower score. 
		Typically, scores will range from about 600 to 700 or above, although 
		some cases will be outside this range.<br /><br />

		<div id="h17">What Kind of Score Do I Need for a Home Loan?</div>
		<br />
		There are as many answers to this question as there are loan programs 
		available. Most lenders will take the average of all 3 scores to 
		evaluate an application. Niche loans, such as Easy Qualifier and low 
		down payment loans will have higher FICO® requirements.<br /><br />

		<div id="h18">How is My Score Determined?</div>
		<br />
		The FICO® model has 5 main elements:<br />
		<ol><li>Past payment history (about 35% of score) The fewer the late payments 
		the better. Recent late payments will have a much greater impact than a 
		very old Bankruptcy with perfect credit since.<br /><br />

		Myth - paying off cards with recent late payments will fix things. 
		Payoffs do not affect payment history.</li>
		<li>Credit use (about 30% of score) Low balances across several cards is 
		better than the same balance concentrated on a few cards used closer to 
		maximums. Too many cards can bring down the score, but closing accounts 
		can often do more harm than good if the entire profile is not 
		considered. BE CAREFUL WHEN CLOSING ACCOUNTS!</li>
		<li>Length of credit history (15% of score) The longer accounts have been 
		open the better for the score. Opening new accounts and closing seasoned 
		accounts can bring down a score a great deal.</li>
		<li>Types of credit used (10% of score) Finance company accounts score lower 
		than bank or department store accounts.</li>
		<li>Inquiries (10% of score) Multiple inquiries can be a risk if several 
		cards are applied for or other accounts are close to maxed out. Multiple 
		mortgage or car inquiries within a 14 day period are counted as one 
		inquiry.</li></ol>
		<div id="h19">How Can I Raise My Score</div>
		<br />
		Your score can only be changed by the way that item is reported directly 
		to the credit bureaus (Experian, TU, Equifax). Written confirmation from 
		the creditor is required. It is best to make these corrections before 
		you try to purchase a home, because you can never be sure the exact 
		impact a change will have on your score.<br /><br />

		<div id="h20">What Does This Mean to Me?</div><br />
		
		You should have your credit reviewed BEFORE you look for a home, and 
		work with a PROFESSIONAL loan officer to make sure your loan is based on 
		the most accurate information.<br /><br />

		<strong>Biweekly Mortgages</strong><br /><br />
		Your lender will probably tell you that a biweekly mortgage is 
		structured just like a traditional fixed-rate, level-payment, fully 
		amortizing mortgage. However, you make your payments every 14 days 
		instead of once a month. The monthly payment is split in half, resulting 
		in the same total monthly mortgage, but the resulting 26 and sometimes 
		27 biweekly payments a year translate into 13 monthly payments, or one 
		extra monthly payment per year.<br />
		<br />
		Borrowers can qualify for a 30-year monthly payment amount, but get a 
		loan that pays off in approximately 22 years at current interest rates. 
		At higher rates, the actual term declines.<br />
		<br />
		If you are looking to build up equity in your home faster without the 
		higher mortgage payments that come with a shorter-term mortgage, you may 
		want to consider the biweekly mortgage. Payments can be deducted from 
		your bank account and scheduled to coincide with your payroll deposits 
		to simplify budgeting. Lenders may charge an initial set-up fee to 
		automatically debit your checking account.<br />

		A temporary buydown is a mortgage on which an initial lump sum payment

		<br />
		<strong>Closing Date</strong><br /><br />

		<br />
		Remember, you need to ensure that the closing occurs before your 
		lender’s commitment letter - and the rate lock-in, if there is one - 
		expire. You can now finalize your moving plans.<br />

		co-maker’s signature guarantees that the loan will be repaid, because 
		the borrower and the co-maker are equally responsible for the repayment.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Coinsurance</strong><br /><br />
		A sharing of insurance risk between the insurer and the insured.

		Payment on the second mortgage is often deferred and carries a very low 
		interest rate (or no interest rate at all). Part of the debt may be 
		forgiven incrementally for each year the buyer remains in the home.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Comparables</strong><br /><br />
		An abbreviation for “comparable properties”; used for comparative 
		purposes in the appraisal process. Comparables are properties like the

		<strong>Condition of the Home</strong><br /><br />
		Potential homeowners should know of major problems in a home before they 
		make an offer. As a potential buyer, you should carefully examine all 
		elements of the home. Ask questions to the seller and the real estate 
		sales professional about any concerns you may have. Both the seller and 
		the real estate agent can be held liable if they do not disclose any 
		defects they know about in the home.<br />
		<br />

		<strong>Construction Contract</strong><br /><br />
		The terms and conditions of any major renovation job should be part of a 
		formal, legally binding contract between you and your contractor - this 
		is called the construction contract. The lender you choose will likely 
		want to review this contract before you sign it.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Construction Loan</strong><br /><br />
		A short-term, interim loan for financing the cost of construction. The 
		lender makes payments to the builder at periodic intervals as the work 
		progresses.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Contingencies for Repairs</strong><br /><br />
		In your purchase offer, you may consider stating that the seller must 
		make sure the electrical systems, heating and cooling, plumbing, and 
		mechanical systems are functioning properly at the closing. You may also 
		state that your purchase is contingent upon the satisfactory completion 
		of a professional home inspection, which will check these systems and 
		other elements more completely. These are both ways to ensure that 
		surprises don’t arise when your moving day arrives.<br />
		<br />
		If you do not include this clause in your contract, you are essentially 
		accepting the house “as is.”<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Contingency</strong><br /><br />
		A condition that must be met before a contract is legally binding. For 
		example, home purchasers often include a contingency that specifies that 
		the contract is not binding until the purchaser obtains a satisfactory 
		home inspection report from a qualified home inspector.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Contingency for Clear Title</strong><br />
		Your purchase contract should include a contingency that the purchase is 
		subject to your receiving clear title to the property. This process 
		includes a title search and title insurance.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Contingency for Financing</strong><br />
		When you make a formal offer on a house, your contract should include a 
		financing contingency. It specifies if you don’t get the money you need 
		to purchase the house at the terms you want, the offer is void and you 
		will be refunded your deposit.<br />
		<br />
		Don’t be surprised if the seller includes a clause in the contract that 
		states you must make a “good faith effort” to get the mortgage. This is 
		the seller’s way to ensure that you explore all options to get a 
		mortgage loan.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Contingency for Personal Property</strong><br />
		Your purchase contract should specify appliances, fixtures, and other 
		personal property that must remain in the home. You can avoid any 
		surprises by listing in your contract everything that is to be left 
		behind when the seller moves out.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Contingency Reserve</strong><br /><br />
		Most mortgages for purchase-renovation require an additional 10 percent 
		of the total cost of the project to be put aside into a reserve account. 
		This contingency reserve is only used when unforeseen repairs or 
		deficiencies are found during renovation.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Contract</strong><br /><br />
		An oral or written agreement to do or not to do a certain thing.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Contractor</strong><br /><br />

		describes the share loans on the individual units.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Cooperative Project</strong><br /><br />

		<br />
		<strong>Cost of Funds Index (COFI)</strong><br /><br />
		An index that is used to determine interest rate changes for certain 
		adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) plans. It represents the weighted-average 
		cost of savings, borrowings, and advances of the 11th District members

		<br />
		<em>*See also “adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)”.</em><br />
		<br />
		<strong>Costs of Settling Into Your Home</strong><br /><br />
		When figuring out how much home you can afford, you need to account for 
		the costs associated with getting into your home.<br />
		<br />
		These can include the cost for repairs that need to be made before you 
		can occupy your residence. There may also be the cost of purchasing 
		appliances, such as a washer and dryer, refrigerator, or stove.<br />
		<br />
		The bottom line is you do not want to spend all your money on purchasing 
		the home and not have any left to pay these types of costs.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Covenant</strong><br /><br />
		A clause in a mortgage that obligates or restricts the borrower and 
		that, if violated, can result in foreclosure.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Credit</strong><br /><br />

		<strong>Credit Bureau</strong><br /><br />
		The three main credit reporting agencies, or credit bureaus, are 
		Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union. You can order a copy of your credit 
		report (a nominal fee may apply) via telephone at:<br />
		<br />
		<em>* Equifax: (800) 685-1111</em><br />
		<br />
		<em>* Trans Union: (800) 916-8800</em><br />
		<br />
		
		<em>* Experian: (800) 682-7654</em><br />
		<br />
		<strong>Credit History</strong><br /><br />
		A record of an individual’s open and fully repaid debts. A credit 
		history helps a lender to determine whether a potential borrower has a 
		history of repaying debts in a timely manner.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Credit Life Insurance</strong><br />
		A type of insurance often bought by mortgagors because it will pay off 
		the mortgage debt if the mortgagor dies while the policy is in force.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Credit Profile</strong><br />
		There are several ways to ensure you have a good credit report and 
		credit score. One of the most effective is to manage your existing 
		credit in a positive way.<br />
		<br />
		Ask your lender for suggestions about ways to control the amount of 
		money you owe. Or, you can choose a credit counselor from the list 
		provided on this site. Some lenders may view consumers as a greater risk 
		if they have used most or all of their available credit. Consumers who 
		are considered “overextended” may be viewed this way even if they have 
		made all their debt payments on time.<br />
		<br />
		Missing a payment on a bill should be avoided, as should late payments 
		on any of your credit obligations. Experiencing a mortgage foreclosure, 
		filing for bankruptcy, or having your vehicle repossessed can also 
		affect your credit score and credit report, limiting your ability to get 
		new credit at a reasonable rate.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Credit Report</strong><br /><br />
		A report of an individual’s credit history prepared by a credit bureau 
		and used by a lender in determining a loan applicant’s creditworthiness.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Credit Report Fee</strong><br /><br />
		The credit report fee covers the lender’s cost for ordering your credit 
		report from a credit bureau.<br />
		<br />
		This report will verify some of the information you provided on your 
		loan application as well as additional information from the credit 
		agency’s files and from public records.<br />
		<br />
		When a credit report is received, your lender will check it against your 
		application and look for any discrepancies. You may be asked to explain 
		information in your credit report.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Credit Reporting Agency</strong><br /><br />
		An organization that prepares reports that are used by lenders to 
		determine a potential borrower’s credit history. The agency obtains data 
		for these reports from a credit repository as well as from other 
		sources.<br />
		<br />
		The three main credit reporting agencies, or credit bureaus, are 
		Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union. You can order a copy of your credit 
		report (a nominal fee may apply) via telephone at:<br />
		<br />
		<em>* Equifax: (800) 685-1111</em><br />
		<br />
		<em>* Trans Union: (800) 916-8800</em><br />
		<br />
		<em>* Experian: (800) 682-7654</em><br />
		<br />
		<strong>Credit Repository</strong><br /><br />
		An organization that gathers, records, updates, and stores financial and 
		public records information about the payment records of individuals who 
		are being considered for credit.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Credit Scoring</strong><br /><br />
		Your credit score is based on all the information in your credit report. 
		This information is converted into a number - a credit score - that the 
		lender uses to determine whether you are likely to repay your loan in a 
		timely manner. The scores used in mortgage lending are typically in the 
		300 to 900 range. A general guide is that the higher your score the 
		better. But you should keep in mind that your credit score is just one 
		of several factors that will be used to evaluate your mortgage loan 
		application.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Credit Unions</strong><br /><br />
		A credit union is a financial institution that is owned and run by its 
		members. It is a nonprofit, cooperative institution that offers members 
		a place to save and borrow. A credit union often works by having its 
		members pool their funds so additional loans can be made to other 
		members.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Creditor</strong><br /><br />
		A person to whom money is owed.<br />
		<br />
		<strong><a name="D">D</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Back">Back to the top</a><br /><br />
		<strong>Debt</strong><br /><br />
		An amount owed to another. See installment loan and revolving liability.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Deed</strong><br /><br />
		The legal document conveying title to a property.<br />
		<br />
		The deed is the document that transfers ownership from the seller to 
		you. Only the seller signs the deed at closing, and you’ll receive a 
		copy of it.<br />
		<br />
		The closing agent will record the deed with you listed as the new 
		property owner. Your name and the names of any other buyers appear on 
		the deed, and it will be sent to you after it is recorded.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Deed of Trust</strong><br /><br />
		The document used in some states instead of a mortgage; title is 
		conveyed to a trustee.<br />
		<br />
		In some states, a “deed of trust” is used instead of a mortgage. When 
		homeowners sign a deed of trust, they receive title to the property but 
		convey title to a neutral third party - called a trustee - until the 
		loan balance is paid in full.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Deed-in-Lieu</strong><br /><br />
		A deed given by a mortgagor to the mortgagee to satisfy a debt and avoid 
		foreclosure. Also called a “voluntary conveyance.”<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Default</strong><br /><br />
		Failure to make mortgage payments on a timely basis or to comply with 
		other requirements of a mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Delinquency</strong><br /><br />
		Failure to make mortgage payments when mortgage payments are due.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Department of Veterans Affairs</strong><br /><br />
		An agency of the federal government that guarantees residential 
		mortgages made to eligible veterans of the military services. The 
		guarantee protects the lender against loss and thus encourages lenders 
		to make mortgages to veterans.<br />
		<br />
		The Veterans Administration is a federal government agency authorized to 
		guarantee loans made to eligible veterans under certain conditions. To 
		obtain more information, you can contact the U.S. Department of Veterans 
		Affairs.<br />
		<br />
		The qualification guidelines for VA loans are more flexible than those 
		for either the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or conventional 
		loans.<br />
		<br />
		If you are a qualified veteran, this can be an attractive mortgage 
		program. To determine whether you are eligible, check with your nearest 
		VA regional office.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Deposit</strong><br /><br />
		A sum of money given to bind the sale of real estate, or a sum of money 
		given to ensure payment or an advance of funds in the processing of a 
		loan.<br />
		<br />
		<em>See earnest money deposit.</em><br />
		<br />
		<strong>Depreciation</strong><br /><br />
		A decline in the value of property; the opposite of appreciation.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Detached Single-Family Home</strong><br /><br />
		The most traditional type of single-family home is one that is 
		“detached.” This type of home stands separate from any other housing 
		structure and serves as a place of residence for the occupants.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Direct Leveraging Loan Program</strong><br /><br />
		The Direct Leveraging Loan Program makes it easier and more economical 
		for rural residents to own a home through lower interest rates and no 
		down payment.<br />
		<br />
		Under this program, the lender offers up to 50 percent of the mortgage 
		amount as a conventional 30-year, fixed-rate first mortgage and the 
		Rural Housing Service (RHS) offers the balance as a second mortgage at 
		an interest rate that is generally below market.<br />
		<br />
		The RHS is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Discount points</strong><br /><br />
		Discount points are often used to describe a type of fee that lenders 
		charge. Discount points are additional funds you pay the lender at 
		closing to get a lower interest rate on your mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		A point equals 1 percent of the loan amount. So, if you and your lender 
		agree to a mortgage of $100,000, one point would equal $1,000.<br />
		<br />
		Typically, each point you pay for a 30-year loan lowers your interest 
		rate by .125 of a percentage point. If the current interest rate on a 
		30-year mortgage is 7.75 percent, paying one point would lower the 
		interest rate to 7.625.<br />
		<br />
		Ask your lender if you have the option of paying 1, 2, or 3 discount 
		points - or you can choose not to pay any discount points. It often 
		makes more sense to pay discount points if you plan to stay in your home 
		for a long time.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Dower</strong><br /><br />
		The rights of a widow in the property of her husband at his death.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Down Payment</strong><br /><br />
		The part of the purchase price of a property that the buyer pays in cash 
		and does not finance with a mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		Saving for a down payment is usually one of the most difficult parts of 
		preparing to buy a home. If you believe you have the needed funds, you 
		are in a better position to seek pre-qualification from a lender to get 
		the mortgage that is right for you.<br />
		<br />
		Most homeowners rely on a mortgage from a financial institution, and 
		most mortgage products require buyers to include a portion of their own 
		funds towards the purchase of the home. This is called the down payment. 
		Lenders feel more secure when buyers include a down payment, indicating 
		they are less likely to walk away from their investment if their 
		finances take a downturn.<br />
		<br />
		Historically, buyers usually made a down payment that totaled 20 percent 
		of the home’s purchase price. Under this scenario, a down payment for a 
		$100,000 home is $20,000. But today, new mortgage products allow buyers 
		to put down as little as 3 percent to 5 percent, provided private 
		mortgage insurance is obtained. The down payment for a $100,000 home 
		with 5 percent down payment is just $5,000.<br />
		<br />
		Sources for down payments may come from buyers’ savings accounts, 
		checking accounts, stocks and bonds, life insurance policies, and gifts.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Due-on-sale Provision</strong><br /><br />
		A provision in a mortgage that allows the lender to demand repayment in 
		full if the borrower sells the property that serves as security for the 
		mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Due-on-transfer Provision</strong><br /><br />
		This terminology is usually used for second mortgages.<br />
		<br />
		<em>*See also “due-on-sale provision”.</em><br />
		<br />
		<strong><a name="E">E</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Back">Back to the top</a><br /><br />
		<strong>Earnest Money Deposit</strong><br /><br />
		A deposit made by the potential home buyer to show that he or she is 
		serious about buying the house.<br />
		<br />
		The earnest money deposit is a “good-faith” payment you submit with your 
		offer on a home to show the seller you are serious about proceeding.<br />
		<br />
		The earnest money is deposited in an escrow account and will be applied 
		to your closing costs.<br />
		<br />
		Sometimes, your lender will want you to bring a receipt for the earnest 
		money deposit along with your sales contract to the initial loan 
		application meeting.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Easement</strong><br /><br />
		A right of way giving persons other than the owner access to or over a 
		property.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Effective Age</strong><br /><br />
		An appraiser’s estimate of the physical condition of a building. The 
		actual age of a building may be shorter or longer than its effective 
		age.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Effective Gross Income</strong><br /><br />
		Normal annual income including overtime that is regular or guaranteed. 
		The income may be from more than one source. Salary is generally the 
		principal source, but other income may qualify if it is significant and 
		stable.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Eminent Domain</strong><br /><br />
		The right of a government to take private property for public use upon 
		payment of its fair market value. Eminent domain is the basis for 
		condemnation proceedings.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Encroachment</strong><br /><br />
		An improvement that intrudes illegally on another’s property.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Encumbrance</strong><br /><br />
		Anything that affects or limits the fee simple title to a property, such 
		as mortgages, leases, easements, or restrictions.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Endorser</strong><br /><br />
		A person who signs ownership interest over to another party. Contrast 
		with co-maker.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)</strong><br /><br />
		A federal law that requires lenders and other creditors to make credit 
		equally available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, 
		national origin, age, sex, marital status, or receipt of income from 
		public assistance programs.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Equity</strong><br /><br />
		A homeowner’s financial interest in a property. Equity is the difference 
		between the fair market value of the property and the amount still owed 
		on its mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		A lender determines how much equity you have in your home by taking the 
		appraised value of the home and subtracting any mortgage debt.<br />
		<br />
		For example, if your house is valued at $150,000 and your mortgage 
		balance is $80,000, you have $70,000 equity in the house.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Errors in Credit Report</strong><br /><br />
		Your credit report may contain inaccuracies. The best way to ensure 
		there are no errors in your credit report is to request copies and 
		review the information.<br />
		<br />
		Since each of the main credit bureaus keeps its own records, you may 
		want to request copies from all three: Trans Union, Equifax, and 
		Experian.<br />
		<br />
		If you have been turned down for credit because of the information in 
		your credit report, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your 
		report within 60 days of the denial. If you haven’t been denied credit, 
		you can still request a copy of your credit report, usually for a 
		nominal fee.<br />
		<br />
		If you find errors in your report, follow the directions in the credit 
		report and contact the agencies to have the errors corrected. They will 
		investigate the targeted items and remove incorrect information.<br />
		<br />
		You don’t have to delay applying for a mortgage while errors in your 
		report are being corrected. Explain the discrepancies in the report to 
		your lender and state that the credit agency is correcting them.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Escrow</strong><br /><br />
		An item of value, money, or documents deposited with a third party to be 
		delivered upon the fulfillment of a condition. For example, the deposit 
		by a borrower with the lender of funds to pay taxes and insurance 
		premiums when they become due, or the deposit of funds or documents with 
		an attorney or escrow agent to be disbursed upon the closing of a sale 
		of real estate.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Escrow Account</strong><br /><br />
		The account in which a mortgage servicer holds the borrower’s escrow 
		payments prior to paying property expenses.<br />
		<br />
		An escrow account is money that is deposited with a third party - 
		outside the buyer and the seller - to be used to pay various fees. A 
		borrower typically provides funds that will pay taxes, mortgage 
		insurance, lease payments, hazard insurance premiums, and other payments 
		when they are due.<br />
		<br />
		An escrow payment by the holder of a mortgage is also known as 
		“impounds” or “reserves” in some states.<br />
		<br />
		When escrow funds are used to pay taxes, hazard insurance, and other 
		fees, it is called an escrow disbursement. Periodically, an escrow 
		analysis will be performed to determine if current monthly deposits 
		provide sufficient funds to pay bills when they are due.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Escrow Analysis</strong><br /><br />
		The periodic examination of escrow accounts to determine if current 
		monthly deposits will provide sufficient funds to pay taxes, insurance, 
		and other bills when due.<br />
		<br />

		pay the borrower’s property taxes, mortgage insurance, and hazard 
		insurance.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Escrow Disbursements</strong><br /><br />
		The use of escrow funds to pay real estate taxes, hazard insurance, 
		mortgage insurance, and other property expenses as they become due.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Escrow Payment</strong><br /><br />
		The portion of a mortgagor’s monthly payment that is held by the 
		servicer to pay for taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage insurance, lease 
		payments, and other items as they become due. Known as “impounds” or 
		“reserves” in some states.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Establishing a Credit Report</strong><br /><br />
		It is possible to establish a credit history even if you do not have a 
		traditional credit record that shows credit card payments or payments on 
		a student or car loan.<br />
		<br />
		You can build a nontraditional credit history, for example, by 
		documenting your monthly payments to previous and current landlords; to 
		utility companies for your gas, water and telephone services; and to 
		insurance companies for medical, life, and automobile coverage.<br />
		<br />
		Your lender can provide further details on how you can effectively 
		establish a credit record.<br />
		<br />

		<br />
		<strong>Fee Simple</strong><br /><br />
		The greatest possible interest a person can have in real estate.<br />
		<br />
		Fee simple ownership provides the owner with unrestricted powers to 
		dispose of the owned property as the owner sees fit. Of all types of 
		ownership a person can have in real estate, fee simple provides the 
		greatest amount of personal control.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Fee Simple Estate</strong><br /><br />
		An unconditional, unlimited estate of inheritance that represents the 
		greatest estate and most extensive interest in land that can be enjoyed. 
		It is of perpetual duration. When the real estate is in a condominium 
		project, the unit owner is the exclusive owner only of the air space 
		within his or her portion of the building (the unit) and is an owner in 
		common with respect to the land and other common portions of the 
		property.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>FHA Coinsured Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		A mortgage (under FHA Section 244) for which the Federal Housing 
		Administration (FHA) and the originating lender share the risk of loss 
		in the event of the mortgagor’s default.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>FHA Loans</strong><br /><br />
		With FHA insurance, you can purchase a home with a low down payment from 
		3 percent to 5 percent of the FHA appraised value or the purchase price, 
		whichever is lower.<br />
		<br />
		FHA mortgages have a maximum loan limit that varies depending on the 
		average cost of housing in a given region. In general, the loan limit is 
		less than what is available with a conventional mortgage through a 
		lender.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>FHA Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		A mortgage that is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). 
		Also known as a government mortgage.<br />

		whichever is lower.<br />
		<br />
		FHA mortgages have a maximum loan limit that varies depending on the 
		average cost of housing in a given region. In general, the loan limit is 
		less than what is available with a mortgage through a lender.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Final Walk-Through Inspection</strong><br /><br />
		Your sales contract should include a clause that allows you to examine 
		the property you want to purchase within the 24 hours before closing.<br />
		<br />
		This walk-through, during which you will be accompanied by the real 
		estate sales professional, is your chance to ensure that the seller has 
		vacated the house and left behind whatever property was agreed upon.<br />
		<br />
		Make sure to check that all lights, appliances, and plumbing fixtures 
		are in working order.<br />
		<br />
		You will also want to make sure that all conditions of the sales 
		contract have been met. If they aren’t, or you observe major problems, 
		you have the right to delay the closing until the problems are 
		corrected.<br />
		<br />
		One other option is to make sure money to correct the problems is placed 
		in an escrow account at closing to cover the cost of repairs.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Financial Index</strong><br /><br />
		An index is a number to which the interest rate on an adjustable rate 
		mortgage (ARM) is tied. It is generally a published number expressed as 
		a percentage, such as the average interest rate or yield on U.S. 
		Treasury bills. A margin is added to the index to determine the interest 
		rate that will be charged on ARMs. This interest rate is subject to any 
		caps associated with the mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		The interest rate changes on an ARM are tied to some type of financial 
		index. Some of the most common type of indexed ARMs are:<br />
		
		<ul><li>Treasury-Indexed ARMs</li>
		<li>CD-Indexed ARMs (Certificate of Deposit)</li>
		<li>Cost of Funds-Indexed ARMs (COFI)</li>
		<li>LIBOR-Based ARMs</li></ul>
		When comparing ARMs, look at how the index to which it is tied has 
		performed recently. Your lender can provide information on how to track 
		the index and a history of the index they use.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Finders Fee</strong><br /><br />
		A fee or commission paid to a mortgage broker for finding a mortgage 
		loan for a prospective borrower.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Firm Commitment</strong><br /><br />
		A lender’s agreement to make a loan to a specific borrower on a specific 
		property.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>First Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		A mortgage that is the primary lien against a property.<br />
		<br />
		A “first mortgage” is the primary lien against a property. The term is 
		usually coined “first mortgage” only when a “second mortgage” is 
		obtained on a property. A “second mortgage” is a lien that is 
		subordinate to the first mortgage. Usually, the interest rates on second 
		mortgages are slightly higher than the interest rates on a first 
		mortgage. The amount of a second mortgage you can take out will depend 
		on the equity you have built up in your home, the appraised value of 
		your property, your credit history, and any other liens you may have 
		against your property, such as a home equity line of credit.<br />
		<br />
		Borrowers will typically get a second mortgage to tap into the equity 
		they’ve built in their home - and use that for home improvements, debt 
		consolidation, medical bills, or other purposes. You apply for a second 
		mortgage with the same process you follow for a first mortgage. However, 
		some of your closing costs may be less.<br />
		<br />
		When you have a first and second mortgage, you theoretically have two 
		loans, both requiring interest and principal payments.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Fixed Installment</strong><br /><br />
		The monthly payment due on a mortgage loan. The fixed installment 
		includes payment of both principal and interest.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Fixed-Period Adjustable-Rate Mortgages</strong><br /><br />
		This type of adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) maintains the same initial 
		interest rate for the first three, five, seven, or 10 years of your 
		loan, depending on the term you choose. Your interest rate then adjusts 
		annually, and can move up or down as market conditions change. Be sure 
		to ask your lender about the interest rate caps for both the annual 
		adjustments and for the life of the loan.<br />
		<br />
		Advantages:<br />
		
		<ul><li>Your initial interest rate will be lower than a fixed-rate mortgage, so 
		you may be able to afford more home.</li>
		<li>You are protected against interest rate increases for the first three, 
		five, seven, or 10 years of the loan, depending on which type of 
		fixed-period ARM you choose.</li>
		<li>You may have the option to convert your ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage at 
		the first, second, or third interest rate adjustment dates.</li>
		<li>You have time to improve your financial position (i.e. salary increases) 
		or accumulate additional assets before the interest rate adjusts at the 
		end of the fixed period.</li></ul>
		Details:<br />
		
		<ul><li>The lifetime interest rate cap for fixed-period ARMs is typically 5 to 6 
		percentage points above your initial rate. Your annual cap during the 
		adjustable period is typically 1 to 2 percentage points above or below 
		over the current rate.</li>
		<li>Can be used to buy one- to four-family residences including second homes 
		and condos, co-ops and planned unit developments. Manufactured homes are 
		also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must be built on a permanent 
		chassis at a factory and then transported to a permanent site and 
		attached to a foundation.)</li></ul>
		<strong>Fixed-Rate Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		A mortgage in which the interest rate does not change during the entire 
		term of the loan.<br /><br />
		Fixed-rate mortgages, the most popular type of mortgage, offer the peace 
		of mind that your interest rate will remain the same for as long as you 
		have your loan. If you expect to live in your home for many years, 
		having the same interest rate may be your key concern. If you decide 
		that you like the stable, predictable payments of a fixed-rate loan, you 
		have the option of choosing from a variety of repayment terms: 15, 20, 
		and 30 years are the most common. Typically, the longer the term of the 
		mortgage, the more interest you pay over the life of your loan. However, 
		stretching out your repayment term means your monthly mortgage payments 
		will be less than they would be with a comparable shorter-term mortgage. 
		Lenders offer a wide array of fixed-rate mortgages:<br />
		<ul><li>Balloon Mortgages</li>
		<li>Biweekly Mortgages</li></ul>
		<strong>Fixture</strong><br /><br />
		Personal property that becomes real property when attached in a 
		permanent manner to real estate.<br /><br />
		<strong>Flood Insurance</strong><br /><br />
		Insurance that compensates for physical property damage resulting from 
		flooding. It is required for properties located in federally designated 
		flood areas.<br /><br />
		<strong>Foreclosure</strong><br /><br />
		The legal process by which a borrower in default under a mortgage is 
		deprived of his or her interest in the mortgaged property. This usually 
		involves a forced sale of the property at public auction with the 
		proceeds of the sale being applied to the mortgage debt.<br /><br />
		If you repeatedly do not make your mortgage payments on time, your 
		lender could sell your home and evict you from it in a legal procedure 
		called foreclosure. A foreclosure on your property can result in the 
		loss of your home and your good credit rating. Foreclosure is most often 
		a last resort effort that lenders will take if you repeatedly don’t make 
		your mortgage payments. Before going to foreclosure, lenders will work 
		with you if you are facing financial hardships to come up with repayment 
		plans that will let you get back on track and remain in your home.<br /><br />
		<strong>Forfeiture</strong><br /><br />
		The loss of money, property, rights, or privileges due to a breach of 
		legal obligation.<br /><br />
		<strong>FSBO (For Sale by Owner)</strong><br /><br />
		For Sale By Owner, or FSBO, is the process of marketing, buying and 
		selling of real estate without the representation of a real estate 
		broker. FSBO can refer to both the individual selling the property “They 
		are a FSBO,” or the property itself “that house is a FSBO.”<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Fully Amortized ARM</strong><br /><br />
		An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) with a monthly payment that is 
		sufficient to amortize the remaining balance, at the interest accrual 
		rate, over the amortization term.<br />

		<strong>General Contractor</strong><br /><br />
		A general contractor is someone whom you may work closely with during 
		your home improvement project. The general contractor is the person who 
		oversees the construction project and handles various aspects such as 
		scheduling workers and ordering supplies.<br />
		<br />
		If you are borrowing mortgage funds to renovate a home, your lender may 
		need to review whether your contractor meets all federal, state, and 
		local registration, licensing and certification standards.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Good Faith Estimate</strong><br /><br />
		The good-faith estimate is a report from your lender that outlines the 
		costs you will incur to get your mortgage. It is based on the lender’s 
		typical loan origination costs for the area where your home is located. 
		The estimate usually changes between application and closing, so you’ll 
		want to review your settlement form before the closing meeting.<br />
		<br />
		The settlement form will list the actual amount of money you’ll need to 
		bring to closing. You’ll need to pay your closing costs in the form of a 
		certified or cashier’s check because personal checks usually are not 
		accepted.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Government Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		A mortgage that is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) 
		or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the Rural

		<strong>Hazard Insurance</strong><br /><br />
		Insurance coverage that in the event of physical damage to a property 
		from fire, wind, vandalism, or other hazards.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)</strong><br /><br />
		A special type of mortgage that enables older home owners to convert the 
		equity they have in their homes into cash, using a variety of payment 
		options to address their specific financial needs. Unlike traditional 
		home equity loans, a borrower does not qualify on the basis of income 
		but on the value of his or her home. In addition, the loan does not have 
		to be repaid until the borrower no longer occupies the property. 
		Sometimes called a reverse mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		A Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) is a type of home loan that 
		lets homeowners aged 62 or over with little or no remaining balance on 
		their mortgage convert their equity into cash. The equity can be paid to 
		the homeowner in a lump sum, in a stream of payments, draws from a line 
		of credit, or a combination of monthly payments and line of credit.<br />
		<br />
		Whatever payment plan you select, you do not have to repay any part of 
		this reverse mortgage until you sell the home or vacate it for another 
		reason. At that time, you pay the loan balance, plus any accrued 
		interest. Any proceeds above that amount go to you or to your estate.<br />
		<br />
		Developed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the HECM mortgage 
		provides a cash growth feature not found with some other reverse 
		mortgages - check with your Fannie Mae approved lender to see how this 
		works based on your personal needs and your payment plan.<br />
		Advantages:<br />
		
		<ul><li>The funds are yours to spend in any way you choose.</li>
		<li>There are no monthly payments with a HECM.</li>
		<li>Your loan funds do not affect Social Security or Medicare benefits. (If 
		you receive Supplemental Social Security or Medicaid, these benefits may 
		be affected.)</li>
		<li>You do not have to pay back the loan until you sell your home or no 
		longer use it for your primary residence. Then, you or your estate will 
		repay the cash you received from the HECM, plus interest and other 
		finance charges to the lender. This means that the remaining equity in 
		your home can be passed on to your heirs through the sale of the 
		property.</li>
		<li>You will never owe more than the value of the home at the time of 
		repayment, even if the loan balance exceeds the value of your property. 
		This means no debt will ever be passed along to the estate or your 
		heirs.</li></ul>
		Details:<br />
		<ul><li>You and any co-borrowers must be at least 62 years old.</li>
		<li>You must own your home outright - or carry a small mortgage balance.</li>
		<li>Eligible properties include a single-family home, a two- to four-unit 
		dwelling, a condominium or a manufactured home. All housing types must 
		meet Federal Housing Administration (FHA) guidelines. (Ask your lender 
		if your property qualifies.)</li>
		<li>Your home must be your principal residence, which means you must live in 
		it more than half the year.</li>
		<li>You must attend pre-application mortgage counseling before you apply for 
		the loan.</li>
		<li>You must keep applicable taxes current, as well as maintain insurance 
		coverage on your home.</li>
		<li>The amount you can borrow with a HECM depends on the age of the youngest 
		borrower(s), the interest rate, how much your house is worth, and the 
		maximum claim amount. In general, you can get between one-third and 
		one-half of your equity as a line of credit or as a lump sum payment.</li>
		<li>The balance of funds advanced against the equity in your home is due and 
		payable when you relinquish your home as a primary residence, or if the 
		borrower(s) pass away. You may have to pay off the debt if you fail to 
		pay property taxes or insurance or if you do not maintain your property.</li></ul><br />
		<strong>Home Equity Line of Credit</strong><br /><br />
		A mortgage loan, which is usually in a subordinate position, that allows 
		the borrower to obtain multiple advances of the loan proceeds at his or 
		her own discretion, up to an amount that represents a specified 
		percentage of the borrower’s equity in a property.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Home Inspection</strong><br /><br />
		A thorough inspection that evaluates the structural and mechanical 
		condition of a property. A satisfactory home inspection is often 
		included as a contingency by the purchaser. Contrast with appraisal.<br />
		<br />
		The home inspection reviews the structural and mechanical condition of 
		the property. This is not an evaluation of the market value of the home 
		or a determination of whether the home complies with applicable building 
		and safety codes. The inspection does not include a recommendation on 
		whether you should or should not buy the house.<br />
		<br />
		The inspector bases the findings on observable structural elements of 
		the home. Potential home buyers are urged to be present during the 
		inspection - this will allow you to ask questions and be in a better 
		position to learn more about any problems that arise.<br />
		<br />
		You should expect to see an evaluation of:<br />
	
		<ul><li>roof and siding,</li>
		<li>windows and doors,</li>
		<li>foundation,</li>
		<li>insulation,</li>
		<li>ventilation,</li>
		<li>heating and cooling systems,</li>
		<li>plumbing and electrical systems,</li>
		<li>walls, floors, and ceilings,</li>
		<li>and any common areas if you are purchasing a condominium or cooperative.</li></ul>
		You should view the home inspection report as a way to identify problems 
		before you buy the home, to help negotiate adjustments in the purchase 
		price if problems exist, and to help get the buyer to make any needed 
		improvements before you buy the home.<br />
		<br />
		Lastly - and for some buyers most importantly - the home inspection 
		report is a way to make you feel confident that the home you are buying 
		includes systems that are in good working condition.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Homeowners Association</strong><br /><br />
		A nonprofit association that manages the common areas of a planned unit 
		development (PUD) or condominium project. In a condominium project, it 
		has no ownership interest in the common elements. In a PUD project, it 
		holds title to the common elements.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Homeowners Insurance</strong><br /><br />
		Homeowner’s insurance -- also called “hazard insurance” - should be 
		equal to at least the replacement cost of the property you want to 
		purchase. Replacement cost coverage ensures that your home will be fully 
		rebuilt in case of a total loss.<br />
		<br />
		Most home buyers purchase a homeowner’s insurance policy that includes 
		personal liability insurance in case someone is injured on their 
		property; personal property coverage for loss and damage to personal 
		property due to theft or other events; and dwelling coverage to protect 
		the house against fire, theft, weather damage, and other hazards.<br />
		<br />
		If the home you want to buy is located near water, you may be able to 
		get flood insurance as part of your homeowner’s protection. In fact, it 
		may be required in some areas, so check with your real estate 
		professional or an approved lender for further information.<br />
		Seek out and compare rates from several insurance companies before 
		making your final decision.<br />
		<br />
		Lenders often want the first year’s premium to be paid at or before 
		closing. Your lender may add the insurance cost to your monthly mortgage 
		payments and keep this portion of your payments in an escrow account. 
		The lender then pays your insurance bill out of escrow when it receives 
		premium notices from your insurance company.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Homeowners Warranty</strong><br /><br />
		A type of insurance that covers repairs to specified parts of a house 
		for a specific period of time. It is provided by the builder or property 
		seller as a condition of the sale.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>HomeStyle Construction-to-Permanent Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		This mortgage gives you the financial power to build your own home - you 
		can borrow money to build a home from the ground up or to finish 
		building a home that’s currently under construction. This loan provides 
		financing from the construction through the purchase phases of your new 
		home.<br />
		<br />
		Advantages:<br />
		
		<ul><li>You enjoy peace of mind by locking in fixed interest rates on both the 
		construction and permanent mortgage financing phases of your home 
		purchase in one convenient loan.</li>
		<li>You can borrow a minimum of 95 percent of the construction cost or the 
		as-completed value of the property (which means your down payment can be 
		as low as 5 percent).</li>
		<li>You can use this mortgage to purchase land upon which you build your 
		home.</li>
		<li>You save money because there is one set of closing costs, compared to 
		those associated with separate loans for construction and occupancy.</li>
		<li>You pay interest only on the funds disbursed during construction.</li>
		<li>This mortgage can be used for construction that’s already under way.</li></ul>
		Details:<br />
		<ul><li>A minimum down payment of 5 percent for a one-unit home and 10 percent 
		for two-unit homes.</li>
		<li>Construction phases of six, nine, or 12 months, with extensions 
		available up to six months, are allowed.</li>
		<li>This loan is available for one- and two-unit owner-occupied homes, 
		one-unit second homes, and one-unit investor homes.</li>
		<li>You can choose a 15- or 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. You can also 
		include the construction phase in these terms, or not, depending on your 
		preference.</li>
		<li>You can also finance with fixed-period ARMs.</li></ul>

		associated with the mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Inflation</strong><br /><br />
		An increase in the amount of money or credit available in relation to 
		the amount of goods or services available, which causes an increase in

		<strong>Lease-Purchase Option</strong><br /><br />
		An alternative financing option that allows low- and moderate-income 
		home buyers to lease a home from a nonprofit organization with an option 
		to buy. Each month’s rent payment consists of principal, interest, taxes 
		and insurance (PITI) payments on the first mortgage plus an extra amount 
		that is earmarked for deposit to a savings account in which money for a 
		downpayment will accumulate.<br />
		<br />
		Nonprofit organizations may use the lease-purchase option to purchase a 
		home that they then rent to a consumer, or “leaseholder.” The 
		leaseholder has the option to buy the home after a designated period of 
		time (usually three or five years). Part of each rent payment is put 
		aside toward savings for the purpose of accumulating the down payment 
		and closing costs.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Leasehold Estate</strong><br /><br />
		A way of holding title to a property wherein the mortgagor does not

		it.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Legal Description</strong><br /><br />
		A property description, recognized by law, that is sufficient to locate 
		and identify the property without oral testimony.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Liabilities</strong><br /><br />
		A person’s financial obligations. Liabilities include long-term and 
		short-term debt, as well as any other amounts that are owed to others.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Liability Insurance</strong><br /><br />
		Insurance coverage that offers protection against claims alleging that a 
		property owner’s negligence or inappropriate action resulted in bodily 
		injury or property damage to another party.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>LIBOR-based ARMs</strong><br /><br />
		The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is based on the interest rate 
		that major international banks are willing to lend and borrow funds for 
		a specified period of time in the London interbank market. The LIBOR is 
		similar to the prime-lending rate posted by major U.S. banks.<br />
		<br />
		You can select an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) that adjusts to the 
		LIBOR at specified periods, usually every six months. This type of ARM 
		typically has a per-adjustment period cap of 1 percent and is offered 
		with either a 5 percent or a 6 percent lifetime rate cap.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Lien</strong><br /><br />
		A legal claim against a property that must be paid off when the property 
		is sold.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Lifetime Payment Cap</strong><br /><br />
		For an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), a limit on the amount that the 
		interest rate can increase or decrease over the life of the mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Lifetime Rate Cap</strong><br /><br />
		For an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), a limit on the amount that the 
		interest rate can increase or decrease over the life of the loan.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Line of Credit</strong><br /><br />

		extend credit up to a certain amount for a certain time to a specified 
		borrower.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Liquid Asset</strong><br /><br />

		<br />
		<strong>Lis Pendens</strong><br /><br />
		A publicly recorded notice of a pending lawsuit against a property owner 
		that may affect the ownership of a property. Some states require lenders 
		to file a lis pendens to begin the foreclosure process if a borrower is 
		in default on loan payments.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Loan</strong><br /><br />
		A sum of borrowed money (principal) that is generally repaid with 
		interest.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Loan Application</strong><br /><br />
		The loan application is a detailed form designed to provide information 
		from you that your lender will need. Lenders use the application to 
		evaluate whether or not they can give you a loan, and if so, the amount 
		of money they can lend you. The “four Cs” of credit come into play when 
		filling out an application -- they are capacity, credit history, capital 
		and collateral.<br />
		<br />
		The loan application form requests information such as:<br />
		
		<ul><li>bank account balances and account numbers, as well as bank branch 
		address;</li>
		<li>information about where you work or what sources of income you have;</li>
		<li>outstanding debts (including loans and credit cards with names and 
		addresses of creditors).</li></ul>
		Information needed for the loan application may vary from lender to 
		lender, so prior to filling out the application it’s important to 
		discuss with your lender what items your lender will need.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Loan Commitment</strong><br /><br />
		The commitment letter states the dollar amount of the loan being 
		offered, the number of years you have to repay the loan, the loan 
		origination fee, the points, the annual percentage rate, and the monthly 
		charges.<br />
		<br />
		The letter also states the time you have to accept the loan offer and to 
		close the loan. Make sure you understand all aspects of the commitment 
		letter because by signing it, you indicate your acceptance of its terms 
		and conditions.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Loan Limit</strong><br /><br />
		The limit on the size of a mortgage which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
		will purchase and/or guarantee. The conforming loan limit is set 
		annually by Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s federal regulator, The Office 
		of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). OFHEO uses the October 
		to October percentage increase/decrease in the average house price in 
		the monthly interest rate survey of the Federal Housing Finance Board 
		(FHFB) to adjust the conforming loan limits for the subsequent year.<br />
		<br />
		Mortgages which exceed the conforming loan limit are known as jumbo 
		mortgages. The interest rate on jumbo mortgages can be higher than the 
		interest rate on conforming mortgages. A borrower whose mortgage amount 
		slightly exceeds the conforming loan limit should analyze the economics 
		of reducing their loan size through a larger downpayment or possibly 
		using secondary financing to qualify for a conforming mortgage verses a 
		jumbo mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Loan Origination</strong><br /><br />
		The process by which a mortgage lender brings into existence a mortgage 
		secured by real property.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Loan Origination Fee</strong><br /><br />
		The loan origination fee covers the administrative costs of processing 
		the loan. It is often expressed in points. One point is 1 percent of the 
		mortgage amount.<br />
		<br />
		For example, a $100,000 mortgage with a loan origination fee of 1 point 
		would mean you pay $1,000.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Loan Terms and Conditions</strong><br /><br />
		With a reverse mortgage, a lender can call in your loan under certain 
		conditions. But, if you occupy the property as your primary residence, 
		are not absent from the property for 12 consecutive months.<br />
		<br />
		You may instruct the lender to pay the taxes and insurance on your 
		behalf from your reverse mortgage funds. The lender will set aside funds 
		from your reverse mortgage to pay for future taxes and insurance, as 
		long as funds are available.<br />
		<br />
		Furthermore, as long as you comply with the terms noted above, you can’t 
		be forced to sell your home to pay off the reverse mortgage, even if the 
		loan balance grows to exceed the value of your property.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Loan-to-Value (LTV) Percentage</strong><br /><br />
		The relationship between the principal balance of the mortgage and the 
		appraised value (or sales price if it is lower) of the property. For 
		example, a $100,000 home with an $80,000 mortgage has a LTV percentage 
		of 80 percent.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Lock-In</strong><br /><br />
		A written agreement in which the lender guarantees a specified interest 
		rate if a mortgage goes to closing within a set period of time. The 
		lock-in also usually specifies the number of points to be paid at 
		closing.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Lock-In Period</strong><br /><br />
		The time period during which the lender has guaranteed an interest rate 
		to a borrower.<br />

		<strong>Manufactured Housing</strong><br /><br />
		Homes and dwellings that are not built at the home site and are moved to 
		the location are considered manufactured housing. Manufactured housing 
		units must be built on a permanent chassis at a factory and then 
		transported to a permanent site and attached to a foundation. All 
		manufactured homes must be built to meet standards set forth by the U.S. 
		Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The standards focus 
		on such aspects as design, strength, energy efficiency, and fire 
		resistance.<br />
		<br />
		Manufactured housing represents one of the fastest-growing housing 
		markets in the United States. Nearly all of the mortgage products are 
		available for owners of manufactured housing.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Margin</strong><br /><br />
		For an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the amount that is added to the 
		index to establish the interest rate on each adjustment date, subject to 
		any limitations on the interest rate change.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Market Value</strong><br /><br />
		You can get a good feel for the market value of a home by asking whether 
		the listing agent compiled a “comparative market analysis (CMA)”. This 
		written report on the property examines comparable homes in the area 
		that have recently been sold, are currently on the market, or are 
		currently under contract.<br />
		<br />
		The CMA will help you figure out whether the asking price is in line 
		with other comparable houses in the neighborhood.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Master Association</strong><br /><br />
		A homeowners’ association in a large condominium or planned unit 
		development (PUD) project that is made up of representatives from 
		associations covering specific areas within the project. In effect, it 
		is a “second-level” association that handles matters affecting the 
		entire development, while the “first-level” associations handle matters 
		affecting their particular portions of the project.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Maturity</strong><br /><br />
		The date on which the principal balance of a loan, bond, or other 
		financial instrument becomes due and payable.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Maximum Claim Amount</strong><br /><br />
		Your maximum claim amount is the lesser of two figures:<br />
	
		<ul><li>Your home’s appraised value.</li>
		<li>HUD 203(b) limit.</li></ul>
		The HUD 203(b) limit is the maximum loan amount that FHA will insure for 
		residences in your geographical area. Check with your lender to get the 
		latest figures for your area.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Maximum Financing</strong><br /><br />
		A mortgage amount that is within 5 percent of the highest loan-to-value 
		(LTV) percentage allowed for a specific product. Thus, maximum financing 
		on a fixed-rate mortgage would be 90 percent or higher, because 95 
		percent is the maximum allowable LTV percentage for that product.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Merged Credit Report</strong><br /><br />
		A credit report that contains information from three credit 
		repositories. When the report is created, the information is compared 
		for duplicate entries. Any duplicates are combined to provide a summary 
		of a your credit.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Modification</strong><br /><br />
		The act of changing any of the terms of the mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Money Market Account</strong><br /><br />
		A savings account that provides bank depositors with many of the 
		advantages of a money market fund. Certain regulatory restrictions apply 
		to the withdrawal of funds from a money market account.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Money Market Fund</strong><br /><br />
		A mutual fund that allows individuals to participate in managed 
		investments in short-term debt securities, such as certificates of 
		deposit and Treasury bills.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Monthly Fixed Installment</strong><br /><br />
		That portion of the total monthly payment that is applied toward 
		principal and interest. When a mortgage negatively amortizes, the 
		monthly fixed installment does not include any amount for principal 
		reduction.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Monthly Payment Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		A mortgage that requires payments to reduce the debt once a month.<br />
		<br />
		Your monthly mortgage payment is composed of four components.<br />
		
		<ul><li>Principal refers to the part of the monthly payment that reduces the 
		remaining balance of the mortgage.</li>
		<li>Interest is the fee charged for borrowing money.</li>
		<li>Taxes and insurance refer to the amounts that are paid into an escrow 
		account each month for property taxes and mortgage and hazard insurance.</li></ul>
		All four of these elements are often referred to as PITI.<br />
		<br />
		Your monthly mortgage payment due may be mailed to you in a book of 
		coupons each year, or in a separate coupon every month.<br />
		<br />
		Ask your lender if the automated underwriting system is used, which may 
		reduce costs associated with your mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		A legal document that pledges a property to the lender as security for 
		payment of a debt.<br />
		<br />
		Simply put, the mortgage is the legal document that gives the lender a 
		legal claim against your house should you default on your loan payments. 
		The mortgage indicates that a specific amount of money will be loaned at 
		a specific interest rate so that you can buy your home. Another way of 
		thinking of the mortgage is that you have possession of the property but 
		the lender has ownership until you have repaid your loan.<br />
		<br />
		The items stated in the mortgage include the homeowner’s responsibility 
		to:<br />
		
		<ul><li>pay principal</li>
		<li>pay interest</li>
		<li>pay taxes</li>
		<li>pay insurance on time</li>
		<li>pay to maintain hazard insurance on the property</li>
		<li>adequately maintain the property</li></ul>
		The mortgage also includes the basic information found in the note.<br />
		<br />
		Should you consistently fail to meet these requirements, your lender can 
		seek full repayment of the balance of the loan, foreclose on the 
		property, or sell the property and use the proceeds to pay off the loan 
		balance and foreclosure costs.<br />
		<br />
		A deed of trust is used instead of a mortgage in some states.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Mortgage Banker</strong><br /><br />
		A company that originates mortgages exclusively for resale in the 
		secondary mortgage market.<br />
		<br />
		Mortgage companies originate and service mortgages. In other words, they 
		make loans to consumers. Mortgage companies then typically sell these 
		loans to other lenders and investors.<br />
		<br />
		Some mortgage companies may be subsidiaries of depository institutions 
		or their holding companies but do not receive money from individual 
		depositors.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Mortgage Broker</strong><br /><br />
		An individual or company that brings borrowers and lenders together for 
		the purpose of loan origination. Mortgage brokers typically require a 
		fee or a commission for their services.<br />
		<br />
		The National Association of Mortgage Brokers defines a mortgage broker 
		as “an independent real estate financing professional who specializes in 
		the origination of residential and/or commercial mortgages.”<br />
		<br />
		There are an estimated 20,000 mortgage brokerage operations from coast 
		to coast. They originate more than half of the residential loans in the 
		U.S.<br />
		<br />
		A mortgage broker has professional expertise that can assist mortgage 
		seekers in finding the best loan for them. The mortgage broker is also 
		experienced in offering many applicable financing options for a 
		consumer’s specific needs.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Mortgage Insurance</strong><br /><br />
		A contract that insures the lender against loss caused by a mortgagor’s 
		default on a government mortgage or conventional mortgage. Mortgage 
		insurance can be issued by a private company or by a government agency 
		such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Depending on the type 
		of mortgage insurance, the insurance may cover a percentage of or 
		virtually all of the mortgage loan.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP)</strong><br /><br />
		The amount paid by a mortgagor for mortgage insurance, either to a 
		government agency such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or to 
		a private mortgage insurance (MI) company.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Mortgage Life Insurance</strong><br /><br />
		A type of term life insurance often bought by mortgagors. The amount of 
		coverage decreases as the principal balance declines. In the event that 
		the borrower dies while the policy is in force, the debt is 
		automatically satisfied by insurance proceeds.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Mortgage-Related Closing Costs</strong><br /><br />
		Mortgage-related closing costs generally are costs associated with your 
		loan application. They vary, but here are some of the most common ones:<br />
		
		<ul><li>Loan origination fee: This fee covers the administrative costs of 
		processing the loan. It may be expressed as a percentage of the loan 
		(for example, 1 percent of the mortgage amount).</li>
		<li>Loan discount points: These points are additional funds you pay the 
		lender at closing to get a lower interest rate on your mortgage. 
		Typically, each point you pay for a 30-year loan lowers your interest 
		rate by .125 of a percentage point. If the current interest rate on a 
		no-point, 30-year mortgage is 7.75 percent, paying one point would lower 
		the interest rate to 7.625. Each point is one percent of the mortgage 
		(for example, if your mortgage is $200,000, one point equals $2,000).</li>
		<li>Appraisal fee: This fee pays for the appraisal, which the lender uses to 
		determine whether the value of the property secures the loan should you 
		default. The home buyer usually pays this fee. It may appear on the 
		settlement form as “POC,” or “paid outside closing.”</li>
		<li>Credit report fee: This covers the cost of the credit report, which the 
		lender uses to determine your creditworthiness.</li>
		<li>Assumption fee: This fee is charged if you take over the payments on the 
		seller’s existing loan. It may range from hundreds of dollars to one 
		percent of the loan amount.</li>
		<li>Prepaid interest: You are charged interest when you borrow money from a 
		lender, and you will pay interest on the mortgage amount from the date 
		of settlement to the beginning of the period covered by the first 
		monthly mortgage payment. At closing, you may be required to pay in 
		advance the interest for the period.</li>
		<li>Escrow accounts: Also called reserves, these accounts are required if 
		your lender will be paying your homeowner’s insurance and property 
		taxes. Your lender sets up the escrow account by adding the cost of the 
		insurance and taxes to your monthly mortgage payments. It is kept in 
		reserve until the bills are due. The bills are sent directly to your 
		lender, who makes the payments for you.</li></ul>
		<strong>Mortgagee</strong><br /><br />
		The lender in a mortgage agreement.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Mortgagor</strong><br /><br />
		The borrower in a mortgage agreement.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Multidwelling Units</strong><br /><br />
		Properties that provide separate housing units for more than one family, 
		although they secure only a single mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Multifamily Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		A residential mortgage on a dwelling that is designed to house more than 
		four families, such as a high-rise apartment complex.<br />
		<br />
		<strong><a name="N">N</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Back">Back to the top</a><br /><br />
		<strong>Negative Amortization</strong><br /><br />
		A gradual increase in mortgage debt that occurs when the monthly payment 
		is not large enough to cover the entire principal and interest due. The 
		amount of the shortfall is added to the remaining balance to create 
		“negative” amortization.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Net Cash Flow</strong><br /><br />
		The income that remains for an investment property after the monthly 
		operating income is reduced by the monthly housing expense, which 
		includes principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI) for the 
		mortgage, homeowners’ association dues, leasehold payments, and 
		subordinate financing payments.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>No Cash-Out Refinance</strong><br /><br />
		A refinance transaction in which the new mortgage amount is limited to 
		the sum of the remaining balance of the existing first mortgage, closing 
		costs (including prepaid items), points, the amount required to satisfy 
		any mortgage liens that are more than one year old (if the borrower 
		chooses to satisfy them), and other funds for the borrower’s use (as 
		long as the amount does not exceed 1 percent of the principal amount of 
		the new mortgage).<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Non-Liquid Asset</strong><br /><br />
		An asset that cannot easily be converted into cash.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Note</strong><br /><br />
		A legal document that obligates a borrower to repay a mortgage loan at a 
		stated interest rate during a specified period of time.<br />
		<br />
		One way to think of the mortgage note is that it is a legal “IOU.” Often 
		called the promissory note, it represents your promise to pay the lender 
		according to the agreed upon terms of the loan, including when and where 
		to send your payment.<br />
		<br />
		The note lists any penalties that will be assessed if you don’t make 
		your monthly mortgage payments. It also warns you that the lender can 
		“call” the loan - demand repayment of the entire loan before the end of 
		the term - if you violate the terms of your mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Note Rate</strong><br /><br />
		The interest rate stated on a mortgage note.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Notice of Default</strong><br /><br />
		A formal written notice to a borrower that a default has occurred and 
		that legal action may be taken.<br />
		<br />
		<strong><a name="O">O</a> </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<a href="#Back">Back to the top</a><br /><br />
		<strong>Occupancy Date</strong><br /><br />
		This provision is a good way to help ensure that your home will be ready 
		for occupancy after the closing takes place. As part of your formal 
		purchase offer, consider including a provision that holds the seller 
		responsible for paying you rent should they not move out on or prior to 
		the agreed-upon date. This allows you, for example, to use the money you 
		receive to pay your own rent if you are leasing your current residence.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Offer</strong><br /><br />
		When you make an offer on a house, it means you are making a formal bid 
		to buy a home. You can work with your real estate sales professional to 
		put together a written bid that abides by the laws in your state. Your 
		offer should include such aspects as the address of the home, the sales 
		price, the type of mortgage financing you will use to purchase the home, 
		any personal property that might be included as part of the sale, and a 
		target date for closing and occupancy. An earnest money deposit 
		typically accompanies the offer. Your real estate sales professional can 
		provide guidance on other elements of the offer.<br />
		<br />
		Once you have made an offer, the seller has the opportunity to accept, 
		decline, or make a counter-offer. If your offer is accepted, you have a 
		ratified sales contract. This contract is the starting point for working 
		with an approved lender to get the mortgage that’s right for you.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>One-Year Adjustable-Rate Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		This adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) offers a low initial interest rate 
		with an interest rate that adjusts annually after the first year. The 
		rate cap per annual adjustment is usually 2 percent; the lifetime 
		adjustment caps can be 5 percent or 6 percent. This type of mortgage may 
		be right for you if you anticipate a rapid increase in income over the 
		first few years of your mortgage. That’s because it lets you maximize 
		your purchasing power immediately. It may also be the right mortgage for 
		you if you plan to live in your home for only a few years.<br />
		<br />
		Advantages:<br />
		
		<ul><li>Maximizes your buying power immediately, especially if you expect your 
		income to rise quickly in the next few years.</li>
		<li>A low first-year interest rate and a 2 percent annual rate cap.<br />
		Some one-year ARMs let you convert to a fixed-rate loan at certain 
		adjustment intervals.</li></ul>
		Ask your approved lender which of their one-year ARMs include this 
		option. Generally, conversions to fixed-rate mortgages are allowed at 
		the third, fourth, or fifth interest rate adjustment dates.<br />
		<br />
		Details:<br />
		
		<ul><li>You can get a one-year ARM with a term from 10 to 30 years. The most 
		typical ones are 10, 15, or 30 years.</li>
		<li>The one-year ARM is most often indexed to the weekly average yield of 
		U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year.</li>
		<li>Can be used to buy one-family, principal residences, including condos, 
		and planned unit developments.</li>
		<li>Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must 
		be built on a permanent chassis at a factory and then transported to a 
		permanent site and attached to a foundation.)</li></ul>
		<strong>Ongoing Costs</strong><br /><br />
		Home buyers should not forget that there are on-going costs associated 
		with owning a home. They include, but are not limited to:<br />
		
		<ul><li>Monthly mortgage payment</li>
		<li>Mortgage insurance</li>
		<li>Homeowner’s insurance</li>
		<li>Property taxes</li>
		<li>Utilities, such as gas, oil, water and electricity</li></ul>
		Another cost home buyers should consider is how much it will cost to 
		maintain their home. These costs include everything from cleaning and 
		minor repairs to yard work and painting.<br />
		<br />
		Condominium owners and people living in planned unit developments should 
		factor in any homeowners’ association fees or similar costs.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Original Principal Balance</strong><br /><br />
		The total amount of principal owed on a mortgage before any payments are 
		made.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Origination Fee</strong><br /><br />
		A fee paid to a lender for processing a loan application. The 
		origination fee is stated in the form of points. One point is 1 percent 
		of the mortgage amount.<br />
		<br />
		The loan origination fee covers the administrative costs of processing 
		the loan. It is often expressed in points. One point is 1 percent of the 
		mortgage amount. For example, a $100,000 mortgage with a loan 
		origination fee of 1 point would mean you pay $1,000.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Other Buyer Costs</strong><br /><br />
		There are other costs associated with the closing that are typically 
		paid by the buyer. They often include:<br />
		<br />
		Fees paid to the lender: Loan discount points, loan origination fee, 
		credit report fee, appraisal fee, and assumption fee.<br />
		Advance payments or prepaid fees: Interest, mortgage insurance premium, 
		and hazard insurance premium.<br />
		Escrow accounts or reserves: State and local law and lenders’ policies 
		vary but these reserves may have to be set up if the lender will be 
		paying property taxes, mortgage insurance, and hazard insurance.<br />
		Title charges: Closing (or settlement) fee, title insurance premium, 
		title search, document preparation fees, and attorney fees. The fees the 
		buyer pays for a real estate attorney are not part of settlement 
		procedures.<br />
		Recording and transfer fees: States often impose a tax on the transfer 
		of property. The payment of a fee for recording the purchasing documents 
		may be required.<br />
		Additional charges: Surveyor’s fees, termite and other pet infestation 
		inspection fees, and the cost of other inspections required by the 
		lender.<br />
		Adjustments: Items paid by the seller in advance and items yet to be 
		paid for which the seller is responsible. The most common expense is 
		property taxes, but others may have to be addressed.<br />
		Other Contingencies<br />
		A contingency in a contract states that if a certain requirement is not 
		met, the deal can be canceled. Some of the most common contingencies 
		related to home purchases include:<br />
		<br />
		Professional home inspection: This states that your sales contract is 
		contingent on a satisfactory report by a professional home inspector. 
		You have the right not to proceed with the purchase of the home, or to 
		re-negotiate the terms of purchase, if any major problems are uncovered.<br />
		Termite inspection: This states that the property is free of both 
		visible termite infestation and termite damage.<br />
		Asbestos: You may choose to hire a qualified professional to inspect the 
		home, take samples for asbestos, and offer solutions to correct any 
		problems.<br />
		Formaldehyde: This colorless, gas chemical was used in foam insulation 
		for homes until the early 1980s and is emitted by some construction 
		materials. It is suspected of causing cancer, and it can also irritate 
		the throat, nose, and eyes. A qualified inspector can let you know if 
		the gas is present in the home you wish to purchase.<br />
		Radon: Most home buyers require that the house be tested for radon, a 
		naturally occurring, odorless gas that can cause health problems.<br />
		Hazardous waste sites: The Environmental Protection Agency has 
		identified contaminated hazardous waste sites across the country. You 
		can contact your EPA regional office for more information.<br />
		Lead-based paint: You should also have the house inspected for 
		lead-based paint, which can lead to very serious health problems. If the 
		house was built before 1950, you can be fairly certain lead-based paint 
		was used. For houses built between 1950 and 1978, there is also a chance 
		lead-based paint was used. Lead disclosure regulations can vary from 
		state to state. Health officials in the state where the home you want to 
		buy is located may be able to provide further guidance.<br />
		The seller or real estate professional must give you a pamphlet that 
		explains lead hazards and tell you about any lead-based paint of which 
		the seller is aware before a sales contract on a home built before 1978 
		can be finalized. The seller must also allow 10 days during which you 
		can hire a professional to conduct an inspection for lead-based paint

		<strong>Other Financial Companies</strong><br /><br />
		Other financial companies include credit unions, mortgage brokers, 
		insurance companies, investment bankers, and housing finance agencies.<br />
		<br />
		Credit unions are cooperative, not-for-profit institutions organized to 
		promote savings and to provide credit, including mortgage loans, to 
		their members. Credit unions either service the mortgages they originate 
		or sell them to other investors.<br />
		<br />
		Mortgage brokers are independent real estate financing professionals who 
		specialize in the origination of residential and/or commercial 
		mortgages. Mortgage brokers originate loans on behalf of other lenders 
		-- including banks, thrifts and mortgage banking companies, but do not 
		service loans.<br />
		Insurance companies and investment bankers are large institutional 
		investors in mortgages that do not receive deposits from consumers. They 
		use premiums from their clients’ insurance polices and investment 
		packages to fund their mortgage lending activities.<br />
		<br />
		Housing finance agencies are typically associated with state or local 
		governments. They are generally geared toward assisting first-time and 
		low- to moderate-income borrowers. They use tax exempt bonds to fund 
		mortgage lending and as a result are often able to provide interest 
		rates that are below current market rates.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Owner Financing</strong><br /><br />

		<strong>Permits</strong><br /><br />
		With most major home improvement projects, work permits may be required. 
		Permits provide legal permission to undertake a project and are usually 
		given by local governments agencies.<br />
		<br />
		Some of the most common permits are for general projects or permits that 
		require you to meet specific local building codes.<br />

		<br />
		<strong>Pre-Approval</strong><br /><br />
		When you work with your lender to get pre-approved, you are getting an 
		indication of how much money you will be eligible to borrow when you 
		apply for a mortgage. This process occurs before you complete an 
		application for a loan.<br />
		<br />
		Pre-approval includes a screening of a borrower’s credit history, and

		Any amount paid to reduce the principal balance of a loan before the due 
		date. Payment in full on a mortgage that may result from a sale of the 
		property, the owner’s decision to pay off the loan in full, or a

		loan has been fully amortized.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Prepayment Penalty</strong><br /><br />
		A fee that may be charged to a borrower who pays off a loan before it is 
		due.<br />

		-- this is referred to as a prepayment penalty.<br />
		<br />
		Any amount that is paid to reduce the principal balance of a loan before 
		the due date - such as the sale of the property, the owner’s decision to 
		pay the loan in full, the owner’s decision to pay additional money every

		<br />
		You may want to consider discussing the specifics of this fee as you 
		negotiate the terms of your loan with your lender.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Prime Rate</strong><br /><br />

		borrowed or the amount that remains to be paid once you have started 
		making payments. It is also the part of the monthly mortgage payment 
		that reduces the remaining balance of a mortgage.<br />

		<strong>Qualifying Guidelines</strong><br /><br />
		There are two main elements lenders consider when determining whether 
		you and any co-borrowers qualify for a specific mortgage.<br />
		<br />
		The first is your monthly mortgage costs, including mortgage payments, 
		property taxes and insurance. If you’re considering buying a condominium 
		or cooperative, any associated fees are also considered. Your mortgage 
		costs should not exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly (pre-tax) 
		income.<br />
		<br />
		The second qualifying guideline relates to your total monthly housing 
		costs and other debts you and any co-borrowers have. These costs should 
		not exceed 36 percent of your gross monthly income.<br />
		<br />
		Lenders follow these guidelines because they believe these percentages 
		allow homeowners to pay off their mortgages fairly comfortably without 
		the worry of loan defaults and foreclosures.<br />
		<br />
		However, these guidelines can be exceeded in certain cases, such as 
		borrowers with a good credit history or with a larger down payment.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Qualifying Ratios</strong><br /><br />
		Calculations that are used in determining whether a borrower can qualify 
		for a mortgage. They consist of two separate calculations: a housing 
		expense as a percent of income ratio and total debt obligations as a 
		percent of income ratio.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Quitclaim Deed</strong><br /><br />
		A deed that transfers without warranty whatever interest or title a 
		grantor may have at the time the conveyance is made.<br />

		<strong>Radon</strong><br /><br />
		A radioactive gas found in some homes that in sufficient concentrations 
		can cause health problems.<br />
		<br />
		
		<strong>Rate Caps</strong><br /><br />
		Lenders offer caps with their adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) so you 
		can have more control over your monthly mortgage payment. Usually, there 
		are two types of rate caps:<br />
		<br />
		A per-adjustment cap, which specifies the most your interest rate can 
		rise from one adjustment period to the next<br />
		A lifetime adjustment cap, which specifies how much your interest rate 
		can rise over the life of your loan<br />
		Ask your lender about both caps when evaluating any ARM product.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Rate Lock</strong><br /><br />
		A commitment issued by a lender to a borrower or other mortgage 
		originator guaranteeing a specified interest rate for a specified period 
		of time.<br />

		<strong>Ratified Sales Contract</strong><br /><br />
		A ratified sales contract means both the buyer and the seller have 
		signed off on the final offer. It also acts as a starting point for the 
		loan application interview.<br />
		<br />
		The ratified sales contract specifies the amount of your down payment, 
		the price you will pay for the house, the type of mortgage financing you 
		will seek, your proposed closing and occupancy dates, and other 
		contingencies.<br />
		<br />
		You will give all this information to your loan officer when you meet to

		Many homeowners hire a real estate attorney to represent them during the 
		loan application process. If you do so, your attorney will review the 
		sales contract and represent you at closing.<br />
		<br />
		There are many questions you can ask a personal attorney before deciding 
		whether to have the attorney represent you at closing. They can include:<br />
		<br />
		What is the attorney’s fee for representing you at closing?<br />
		What is the attorney’s experience with real estate transactions?<br />
		Are there fees for reading documents relating to the closing?<br />
		Are there fees for giving advice?<br />
		Remember that your personal attorney’s fee is not part of your closing 
		costs. You must pay for this expense separately.<br />

		a savings account in which money for a downpayment will accumulate.<br />
		<br />
		Lease-Purchase Option: Nonprofit organizations may use the 
		lease-purchase option to purchase a home that they then rent to a 
		consumer, or “leaseholder.” The leaseholder has the option to buy the 
		home after a designated period of time (usually three or five years). 
		Part of each rent payment is put aside toward savings for the purpose of 
		accumulating the down payment and closing costs.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>REO (Real Estate Owned)</strong><br /><br />

		how the financing option works.<br />
		<br />
		During your counseling, you will receive an estimate of your loan 
		advances and an explanation of your responsibilities as a borrower. 
		Other sources of unbiased information education may also be provided. A 
		non-profit agency or a local lender typically conducts the counseling.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Revolving Liability</strong><br /><br />
		A credit arrangement, such as a credit card, that allows a customer to 
		borrow against a preapproved line of credit when purchasing goods and 
		services. The borrower is billed for the amount that is actually

		<strong>Seller Versus Buyer Closing Costs</strong><br /><br />
		Buyers and sellers often negotiate who will pay certain closing costs, 
		and the results vary depending on the negotiated deal. In fact, it’s not 
		uncommon for a sales agreement to state that either the buyer or seller 
		pays all closing costs. The agreement that you and the seller reach must 
		be specified in the sales contract.<br />
		<br />
		Your negotiations could depend on a variety of factors, including the 
		quality of the home, how long the home has been on the market, whether 
		there are any other interested buyers, and how motivated the seller is 
		to sell the home.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Servicer</strong><br /><br />

		The collection of mortgage payments from borrowers and related 
		responsibilities of a loan servicer.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Settlement</strong><br /><br />
		The final step before you get the keys to your home is a formal meeting 
		called the closing. It is at this meeting in which ownership of the home 
		is transferred from the seller to the buyer.<br />
		<br />
		Also called a settlement in some parts of the country, the meeting is 
		typically attended by the buyer(s), the seller(s), their attorneys if 
		they have them, both real estate sales professionals, a representative 
		of the lender, and the closing agent. The purpose is to make sure the 
		property is physically and legally ready to be transferred to you.<br />
		<br />
		Several closing costs will be paid at this meeting. These expenses are 
		over and above the price of the property and are incurred when ownership 
		of a property is transferred. Closing costs generally include a loan 
		origination fee, an attorney’s fee, taxes, an amount placed in escrow, 
		and charges for obtaining title insurance, and a survey. Closing costs 
		vary according to the area of the country.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Settlement Sheet</strong><br /><br />
		The HUD-1 Settlement Statement itemizes the amounts to be paid by the 
		buyer and the seller at closing. The (blank) form is published by the 
		U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).<br />
		<br />
		Items on the statement include:<br />
		
		<ul><li>real estate commissions</li>
		<li>loan fees</li>
		<li>points</li>
		<li>escrow amounts</li></ul>

		<br />
		<strong>Six-Month Adjustable-Rate Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		This adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) offers a low initial interest rate 
		for the first six months with an interest rate that adjusts every six 
		months thereafter. The rate caps per adjustment can be 1 percent or 2 
		percent; the lifetime adjustment caps can be 4 percent, 5 percent, or 6 
		percent. This type of mortgage may be right for you if you anticipate a 
		rapid increase in income over the first few years of your mortgage. 
		That’s because it lets you maximize your purchasing power immediately. 
		It may also be the right mortgage for you if you plan to live in your 
		home for only a few years.<br />
		<br />
		The interest rate is tied to a published financial index. When comparing 
		ARMs that have different indexes, look at how the index has performed 
		recently. Your an approved lender can provide information on how to 
		track a specific index and how to review a 15-year history of the index.<br />
		<br />
		Advantages:<br />
		
		<ul><li>Maximizes your buying power immediately, especially if you expect your 
		income to rise quickly in the next few years.</li>
		<li>Lets you select an index that meets your financial needs.</li>
		<li>Easier to qualify for due to a low interest rate and a 1 or 2 percent 
		annual rate cap.</li>
		<li>Some six-month ARMs let you convert to a fixed-rate loan at certain 
		adjustment intervals. Ask your Fannie Mae approved lender which of their 
		six-month ARMs include this option. Your lender can also provide further 
		specifics about this mortgage option.</li></ul>
		Details:<br />
		<ul><li>You can get a six-month ARM with a term of 10 to 30 years. Typically, 
		they are 10, 15, or 30 years.</li>
		<li>Can be used to buy one- to four-family, owner-occupied principal 
		residences including second homes, investment properties, and condos, 
		co-ops and planned unit developments.</li>
		<li>Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must 
		be built on a permanent chassis at a factory and then transported to a 
		permanent site and attached to a foundation.)</li></ul>

		An alternative financing option known as the Community Seconds® mortgage 
		for low- and moderate-income households. An investor purchases a first 
		mortgage that has a subsidized second mortgage behind it. The second 
		mortgage may be issued by a state, county, or local housing agency, 
		foundation, or nonprofit corporation. Payment on the second mortgage is 
		often deferred and carries a very low interest rate (or no interest 
		rate). Part of the debt may be forgiven incrementally for each year the 
		buyer remains in the home.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Survey</strong><br /><br />
		A drawing or map showing the precise legal boundaries of a property, the 
		location of improvements, easements, rights of way, encroachments, and 
		other physical features.<br />
		<br />
		Your lender may require you to have a survey of the property performed. 
		This process confirms that the property’s boundaries are correctly 
		described in the purchase and sale agreement.<br />
		<br />
		Also called a plot plan, the survey may show a neighbor’s fence is 
		located on the seller’s property or more serious violations may be 
		discovered. These violations must be addressed before the lender will 
		proceed.<br />
		<br />
		The buyer usually pays to have the survey done, but some cost savings 
		may be found by requesting an “update” from the company that previously 
		surveyed the property.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Sweat Equity</strong><br /><br />
		Contribution to the construction or rehabilitation of a property in the 
		form of labor or services rather than cash.<br />

		<strong>Taxes and Insurance</strong><br /><br />
		You’ll hear many terms as you work with your mortgage lender, and one of 
		the most frequently mentioned is “PITI.” This abbreviation stands for 
		principal, interest, taxes and insurance.<br />
		<br />
		The tax and insurance components of a mortgage payment are generally 
		held by the lender in an escrow account. The lender pays any property 
		tax and homeowner’s insurance bills as they are due, ensuring they are 
		paid on time.<br />
		<br />
		A home buyer’s monthly mortgage payment generally covers expenses 
		through the escrow account. If you don’t have your homeowner’s insurance 
		and property taxes paid out of a lender escrow account, your local 
		government and your property insurance company will send payment notices 
		directly to you. It is your responsibility to make sure you pay these 
		bills on time.<br />
		<br />
		If you’re planning to purchase a condominium or cooperative, talk to 
		your lender about how they view condo and co-op fees. Most likely, they 
		are considered housing costs and not a part of PITI. However, this can 
		vary from lender to lender.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Tenancy by the Entirety</strong><br /><br />
		A type of joint tenancy of property that provides right of survivorship 
		and is available only to a husband and wife. Contrast with tenancy in 
		common.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Tenancy in Common</strong><br /><br />
		A type of joint tenancy in a property without right of survivorship. 
		Contrast with tenancy by the entirety and with joint tenacy.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Tenant-Stockholder</strong><br /><br />
		The obligee for a cooperative share loan, who is both a stockholder in a 
		cooperative corporation and a tenant of the unit under a proprietary 
		lease or occupancy agreement.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Termite Inspection</strong><br /><br />
		Homes in many parts of the country must be inspected for termites before 
		they can be sold. You should receive a certificate from a termite 
		inspection firm stating that the property is free of both visible 
		termite infestation and termite damage.<br />
		<br />
		The cost of the termite inspection is usually paid by the seller, and 
		the seller’s real estate sales professional orders the inspection. You 
		need to make sure that the original certificate is delivered to your 
		lender at least three days before closing.<br />
		<br />
		This allows the lender to review the certificate and address any 
		potential problems.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Third-Party Origination</strong><br /><br />
		A process by which a lender uses another party to completely or 
		partially originate, process, underwrite, close, fund, or package the 
		mortgages it plans to deliver to the secondary mortgage market.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Thrifts</strong><br /><br />
		Thrifts are depository institutions that primarily serve consumers and 
		include both savings banks and savings and loan (S&amp;L) institutions. 
		These institutions originate and service mortgage loans. A thrift may 
		choose to hold a loan in its own portfolio or sell the loan to an 
		investor.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Title</strong><br /><br />
		A legal document evidencing a person’s right to or ownership of a 
		property.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Title Company</strong><br /><br />
		A company that specializes in examining and insuring titles to real 
		estate.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Title Insurance</strong><br /><br />
		Insurance that protects the lender (lender’s policy) or the buyer 
		(owner’s policy) against loss arising from disputes over ownership of a 
		property.<br />
		<br />
		Your lender will require that you buy title insurance to ensure that you 
		are receiving a “marketable title”. There are two types of title 
		insurance policies:<br />
		
		<ul><li>Lender’s policy (mandatory): This protects the lender should a flaw in 
		the title be detected after the property has been purchased.</li>
		<li>Owner’s policy (optional, but recommended): This protects you should a 
		flaw in the title be detected after the property has been purchased.</li></ul>
		Generally, the buyer pays the cost of both policies. Check with your 
		insurer, because you may receive a price break if you seek a combined 
		lender/owner policy or if you purchase a “reissue” policy from the 
		company that previously insured the title.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Title Search</strong><br /><br />
		A check of the title records to ensure that the seller is the legal 
		owner of the property and that there are no liens or other claims 
		outstanding.<br />
		<br />
		In order to make sure the borrower will receive clear title to the 
		property, lenders require a title search. It attempts to uncover any 
		“encumbrances” on the title and makes sure the seller is the actual 
		owner of the property.<br />
		<br />
		Encumbrances include any liens - legal claims against a property filed 
		by creditors as a means to collect unpaid bills. Liens can also be filed 
		by the Internal Revenue Service for nonpayment of taxes. Any such claims 
		must be paid by the seller - this often occurs either before or at the 
		closing.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Total Expense Ratio</strong><br /><br />
		Total obligations as a percentage of gross monthly income. The total 
		expense ratio includes monthly housing expenses plus other monthly 
		debts.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Townhouse</strong><br /><br />
		A townhouse is similar to a condominium in that it’s a type of joint 
		real estate where each housing unit is individually owned. However, it 
		has two or more stories, rather than the typical one floor found in a 
		condominium.<br />
		<br />
		Townhouses are available in many shapes and sizes, and most may have 
		yards or common spaces that can be used by the owners.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Trade Equity</strong><br /><br />
		Equity that results from a property purchaser giving his or her existing 
		property (or an asset other than real estate) as trade as all or part of 
		the down payment for the property that is being purchased.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Transfer of Ownership</strong><br /><br />
		Any means by which the ownership of a property changes hands. Lenders 
		consider all of the following situations to be a transfer of ownership: 
		the purchase of a property “subject to” the mortgage, the assumption of 
		the mortgage debt by the property purchaser, and any exchange of 
		possession of the property under a land sales contract or any other land 
		trust device. In cases in which an inter vivos revocable trust is the 
		borrower, lenders also consider any transfer of a beneficial interest in 
		the trust to be a transfer of ownership.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Transfer Tax</strong><br /><br />
		State or local tax payable when title passes from one owner to another.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Treasury Index</strong><br /><br />
		An index that is used to determine interest rate changes for certain 
		adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) plans. It is based on the results of 
		auctions that the U.S. Treasury holds for its Treasury bills and 
		securities or is derived from the U.S. Treasury’s daily yield curve, 
		which is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded 
		Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Trustee</strong><br /><br />
		A fiduciary who holds or controls property for the benefit of another.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Truth-In-Lending</strong><br /><br />
		A federal law that requires lenders to fully disclose, in writing, the 
		terms and conditions of a mortgage, including the annual percentage rate 
		(APR) and other charges.<br />
		<br />
		Your lender should provide you with the Truth-in-Lending (TIL) Statement 
		within three business days of your loan application. This document 
		outlines the costs of your loan, and it is given to you so you can 
		compare the costs with those of other lenders. Among the costs listed:<br />
		
		<ul><li>The annual percentage rate (APR), which is the cost of your mortgage 
		compiled as a yearly rate. It may be higher than the interest rate 
		stated in your mortgage because it includes points and other costs of 
		credit.</li>
		<li>The finance charge.</li>
		<li>The amount financed.</li>
		<li>The payment amount.</li>
		<li>The total payments required.</li></ul>
		The lender is required to give you the final version of your TIL 
		Statement at or prior to the closing meeting because it is possible that 
		the APR calculated at your loan application will change at closing.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Two-Step Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		The Two-Step Mortgage is a special type of adjustable-rate mortgage 
		(ARM) that adjusts only once. Depending on whether you select a 
		five-year or seven-year Two-Step Mortgage, your interest rate will 
		adjust once at the end of either five or seven years. Then, your 
		interest rate stays the same for the remaining 25 or 23 years of your 
		30-year loan.<br />
		<br />
		Advantages:<br />
		
		<ul><li>You can qualify with a low starting interest rate. Your initial interest 
		rate is only slightly higher than a balloon loan and is often lower than 
		a 30-year fixed rate loan.</li>
		<li>You get stable, predictable payments for five or seven years and, after 
		adjustment, for the remaining 25 or 23 years of the loan.<br />
		You are protected from rising interest rates during the early years of 
		homeownership.</li>
		<li>You do not have to re-qualify or pay refinance costs at the time the 
		interest rate adjusts.</li>
		<li>You have time to increase your earnings or accumulate additional assets 
		before the interest rate adjusts at the end of five or seven years.</li></ul>
		Details:<br />
		
		<ul><li>Your interest rate cap can be no more than 6 percent above your initial 
		interest rate.</li>
		<li>You can use this mortgage to buy one- to four-family residences 
		including second homes and condos, co-ops and planned unit developments.</li>
		<li>Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must 
		be built on a permanent chassis at a factory and then transported to a 
		permanent site and attached to a foundation.)</li></ul>
		<strong>Two-to Four-Family Property</strong><br /><br />
		A property that consists of a structure that provides living space 
		(dwelling units) for two to four families, although ownership of the 
		structure is evidenced by a single deed.<br />
		<br />
		<strong><a name="U">U</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Back">Back to the top</a><br /><br />
		<strong>Underwriting</strong><br /><br />
		The process of evaluating a loan application to determine the risk 
		involved for the lender. Underwriting involves an analysis of the 
		borrower’s creditworthiness and the quality of the property itself.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Unsecured Loan</strong><br /><br />
		A loan that is not backed by collateral.<br />
		<br />
		<strong><a name="V">V</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Back">Back to the top</a><br /><br />
		<strong>VA Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		A mortgage that is guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
		(VA).<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Vested</strong><br /><br />
		Having the right to use a portion of a fund such as an individual 
		retirement fund. For example, individuals who are 100 percent vested can 
		withdraw all of the funds that are set aside for them in a retirement 
		fund. However, taxes may be due on any funds that are actually 
		withdrawn.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Veterans Administration (VA)</strong><br /><br />
		The Veterans Administration is a federal government agency authorized to 
		guarantee loans made to eligible veterans under certain conditions. To 
		obtain more information, you can contact the U.S. Department of Veterans 
		Affairs.<br />
		<br />
		VA loans are more flexible than those for either the Federal Housing 
		Administration (FHA) or conventional loans.<br />
		<br />
		If you are a qualified veteran, this can be an attractive mortgage 
		program. To determine whether you are eligible, check with your nearest 
		VA regional office.<br />

		<strong>Ways of Obtaining a Loan</strong><br /><br />
		You have several ways to get a mortgage. Your loan interview can take 
		place, in whole or in part, over the telephone, over the Internet, or in 
		person.<br />
		<br />
		Approved lenders have a variety of options when it comes to helping you 
		get the mortgage that’s right for you. Many lenders have Web sites that 
		let you fill out an application online, which can save you time. Other 
		lenders may work with you over the telephone.<br />
		<br />
		Review our approved lenders list in the Find a Lender section to locate 
		the lender that provides the services you prefer.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>What-If Analysis</strong><br /><br />
		An affordability analysis that is based on a what-if scenario. A what-if 
		analysis is useful if you do not have complete data or if you want to 
		explore the effect of various changes to your income, liabilities, or 
		available funds or to the qualifying ratios or down payment expenses 
		that are used in the analysis.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>What-If Scenario</strong><br /><br />
		A change in the amounts that is used as the basis of an affordability 
		analysis. A what-if scenario can include changes to monthly income, 
		debts, or down payment funds or to the qualifying ratios or down payment 
		expenses that are used in the analysis. You can use a what-if scenario 
		to explore different ways to improve your ability to afford a house.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Wraparound Mortgage</strong><br /><br />
		A mortgage that includes the remaining balance on an existing first 
		mortgage plus an additional amount requested by the mortgagor. Full 
		payments on both mortgages are made to the wraparound mortgagee, who 
		then forwards the payments on the first mortgage to the first mortgagee.</p>
