		<div id="h2">Closing Costs When Buying or Refinancing a Home</div><br />
		This is a detailed summary of costs you may have to pay when you buy or 
		refinance your home. They are listed in the order that they should 
		appear on a Good Faith Estimate you obtain from a mortgage lender. There 
		are two broad categories of closing costs. Non-recurring closing costs 
		are items that are paid once and you never pay again. Recurring closing 
		costs are items you pay time and again over the course of home 
		ownership, such as property taxes and homeowner’s insurance. Some of the 
		items that appear here do not traditionally appear on a lender’s Good 
		Faith Estimate and lenders are not required to show all of these items.<br /><br/>

		<div id="h3">Non-Recurring Closing Costs Associated with the Lender.</div>
		<br />
		<strong>Loan Origination Fee</strong> - The loan origination fee is often referred to as 
		points. One point is equal to one percent of the mortgage loan. As a 
		rule, if you are willing to pay more in points, you will get a lower 
		interest rate. On a VA or FHA loan, the loan origination fee is one 
		point. Any additional points are called discount points.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Loan Discount </strong>- On a government loan, the loan origination fee is 
		normally listed as one point or one percent of the loan. Any points in 
		addition to the loan origination fee are called discount points. On a 
		conventional loan, discount points are usually lumped in with the loan 
		origination fee.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Appraisal Fee</strong> - Since your property serves as collateral for the 
		mortgage, lenders want to be reasonably certain of the value and they 
		require an appraisal. The appraisal looks to determine if the price you 
		are paying for the home is justified by recent sales of comparable 
		properties. The appraisal fee varies, depending on the value of the home 
		and the difficulty involved in justifying value. Unique and more 
		expensive homes usually have a higher appraisal fee. Appraisal fees on 
		VA loans are higher than on conventional loans.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Credit Report</strong> - As part of the underwriting review, your mortgage lender 
		will want to review your credit history. The cost of running the credit 
		report can vary and is included in closing costs.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Lender’s Inspection Fee</strong> - You normally find this fee on new construction 
		and is associated with what is called a 442 Inspection. Since the 
		property is not finished when the initial appraisal is done, the 442 
		Inspection is done when the building is completed and verifies that 
		construction is complete with carpeting and flooring installed.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Mortgage Broker Fee</strong> - About seventy percent of loans are originated 
		through mortgage brokers and they will sometimes list your points in 
		this area instead of the Loan Origination Fee category. They may also 
		add any broker processing fees in this area so you clearly understand 
		how much is being charged by the wholesale lender and how much is being 
		charged by the broker. Wholesale lenders offer lower costs/rates to 
		mortgage brokers than you can obtain directly, so you are not paying 
		extra by going through a mortgage broker.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Tax Service Fee</strong> - During the life of your loan you will be making 
		property tax payments, either on your own or through your impound 
		account with the lender. Since property tax liens can sometimes take 
		precedence over a first mortgage, it is in your lender’s interest to pay 
		an independent service to monitor property tax payments.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Flood Certification Fee</strong> - Your lender must determine whether or not your 
		property is located in a federally designated flood zone. This is a fee 
		usually charged by an independent service to make that determination.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Flood Monitoring</strong> - From time to time flood zones are re-mapped. Some 
		lenders charge this fee to maintain monitoring on whether this 
		re-mapping affects your property.<br /><br/>

		<div id="h4">Other Lender Fees</div>
		<br />
		We put these in a separate category because they vary so much from 
		lender to lender and cannot be associated directly with a cost of the 
		loan. These fees generate income for the lenders and are used to offset 
		the fixed costs of loan origination. The Processing Fee mentioned above 
		can also fall into this category, but since it is listed higher on the 
		Good Faith Estimate Form we did not also include it here. You will 
		normally find some combination of these fees on your Good Faith 
		Estimate.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Document Preparation</strong> - Before computers made it fairly easy for lenders 
		to draw their own loan documents, they used to hire specialized document 
		preparation firms for this function. This was the fee charged by those 
		companies. Nowadays, lenders draw their own documents but this fee is 
		charged on almost all loans.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Underwriting Fee</strong> - Once again, it is difficult to determine the exact 
		cost of underwriting a loan since the underwriter is usually a paid 
		staff member.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Administration Fee</strong> - If an Administration Fee is charged, you will 
		probably find there is no Underwriting Fee. This is not always the case.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Appraisal Review Fee</strong> - Even though you will probably not see this fee on 
		your Good Faith Estimate, it is charged occasionally. Some lenders 
		routinely review appraisals as a quality control procedure, especially 
		on higher valued properties.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Warehousing Fee</strong> - This is rarely charged and begins to border on the 
		ridiculous. However, some lenders have a warehouse line of credit and 
		add this as a charge to the borrower.<br /><br/>

		<div id="h5">Items Required to be Paid in Advance</div>
		<br />
		<strong>Pre-paid Interest</strong> - Mortgage loans are usually due on the first of each 
		month. Since loans can close on any day, a certain amount of interest 
		must be paid at closing to get the interest paid up to the first. For 
		example, if you close on the twentieth, you will pay ten days of 
		pre-paid interest.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Homeowner’s Insurance</strong> - This is the insurance you pay to cover possible 
		damages to your home and other items. If you buy a home, you will 
		normally pay the first year’s insurance when you close the transaction. 
		If you are buying a condominium, your Homeowners’ Association Fees 
		normally cover this insurance.<br /><br/>

		<strong>VA Funding Fee</strong> - On VA loans, the Veterans Administration charges a fee 
		for guaranteeing your loan. The fee will be a percentage of the loan 
		balance but the exact percentage will vary depending on whether you have 
		used your VA eligibility in the past. Instead of actually paying this as 
		an out-of-pocket expense, most veterans choose to finance it, so it gets 
		added to the loan balance. This is why the loan balance on VA loans can 
		be higher than the actual purchase amount.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Up Front Mortgage Insurance Premium (UFMIP)</strong> - This is charged on FHA 
		purchases of single-family residences (SFR’s) or Planned Unit 
		Developments (PUDs). Like the VA Funding Fee it is normally added to the 
		balance of the loan. Unlike a VA loan, the homebuyer must also pay a 
		monthly mortgage insurance fee, too. This is why many lenders do not 
		recommend FHA loans if the homebuyer can qualify for a conventional 
		loan. Condominium purchases do not require the UFMIP.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Mortgage Insurance</strong> - Though it is rare nowadays, some first-time 
		homebuyer programs still require the first year mortgage insurance 
		premium to be paid in advance. Most mortgage insurance (when required) 
		is simply paid monthly along with your mortgage payment. Mortgage 
		insurance covers the lender and covers a portion of the losses in those 
		cases where borrowers default on their loans.<br /><br/>

		<div id="h6">Reserves Deposited with Lender</div>
		<br />
		If you make a minimum down payment, you may be required to deposit funds 
		into an impound account. Funds in this account are your funds, and the 
		lender uses them to make the payments on your homeowner’s insurance, 
		property taxes, and mortgage insurance (whichever is applicable). Each 
		month, in addition to your mortgage payment, you provide additional 
		funds which are deposited into your impound account.<br /><br/>

		The lender’s goal is to always have sufficient funds to pay your bills 
		as they come due. Sometimes impound accounts are not required, but 
		borrowers request one voluntarily. A few lenders even offer to reduce 
		your loan origination fee if you obtain an impound account. However, if 
		you are disciplined about paying your bills and an impound account is 
		not required, you can probably earn a better rate of return by putting 
		the funds into a savings account. Impound accounts are sometimes 
		referred to as escrow accounts.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Homeowners Insurance Impounds</strong> - your lender will divide your annual 
		premium by twelve to come up with an estimated monthly amount for you to 
		pay into your impound account. Since a lender is allowed to keep two 
		months of reserves in your account, you will have to deposit two months 
		into the impound account to start it up.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Property Tax Impounds</strong> - How much you will have to deposit towards taxes 
		to start up your impound account varies according to when you close your 
		real estate transaction. For example, you may close in November and 
		property taxes are due in December. Your deposit would be higher than 
		for someone closing in May.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Mortgage Insurance Impounds</strong> - When required, most lenders allow this to 
		simply be paid monthly. However, you may be required to put two months’ 
		worth of mortgage insurance as an initial deposit into your impound 
		account.<br /><br/>

		<div id="h7">Non-Recurring Closing Costs not associated with the Lender</div>
		<br />
		<strong>Closing/Escrow/Settlement Fee</strong> - Methods of closing a real estate 
		transaction vary from state to state, as do the fees.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Title Insurance</strong> - Title Insurance assures the homeowner that they have 
		clear title to the property. The lender also requires it to insure that 
		their new mortgage loan will be in first position. The costs vary 
		depending on whether you are purchasing a home or refinancing.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Notary Fees</strong> - Most sets of loan documents have two or three forms that 
		must be notarized. Usually your settlement or escrow agent will arrange 
		for you to sign these forms at their office and will charge a notary 
		fee.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Recording Fees</strong> - Certain documents get recorded with your local county 
		recorder. Fees vary regionally.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Pest Inspection</strong> - This is also referred to as a Termite Inspection. This 
		inspection tests not only for pest infestations, but also other items 
		such as wood rot and water damage. If repairs are required, the amount 
		to cover those repairs can vary. The seller will usually pay for the 
		most serious repairs, but this is a negotiable item. Usually (not 
		always) the pest inspection fee is paid by the seller of the home and is 
		not normally reflected on the Good Faith Estimate.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Home Inspection</strong> - Since it is the homebuyer’s choice to obtain a home 
		inspection or not, this cost is not usually reflected on a Good Faith 
		Estimate. However, it is recommended. Keep in mind that the home 
		inspector has a certain set of standards he uses when inspecting a home, 
		and those standards may be higher than required by local building codes. 
		An example is that an inspector may note there is no spark arrestor on a 
		chimney but the local building code may not require it. This sometimes 
		leads to conflicts between buyer and seller.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Home Warranty</strong> - This is also an optional item and not normally included 
		on the Good Faith Estimate. A Home Warranty usually covers such items as 
		the major appliances, should they break down within a specific time. 
		Often this is paid by the seller.<br /><br/>

		<div id="h8">Refinancing Associated Costs (but not charged by the new Lender)</div>
		<br />
		<strong>Interest</strong> - When you close the transaction on your refinance, there will 
		most likely be some outstanding interest due on the old loan. For 
		example, if you close on August twentieth (and you made your last 
		payment), you will have twenty days interest due on the old loan and ten 
		days prepaid interest on the new loan. Your first payment on the new 
		loan would not be until October 1st since you have already paid all of 
		August’s interest when you closed the refinance transaction (since 
		interest is paid in arrears, a September payment would have paid 
		August’s interest, which has already been paid in closing).<br /><br/>

		<strong>Reconveyance Fee</strong> - This fee is charged by your existing lender when they 
		“reconvey” their collateral interest in your property back to you 
		through recording of a Reconveyance.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Demand Fee</strong> - Your existing lender may charge a fee for calculating 
		payoff figures.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Sub-Escrow fee</strong> - Though it sounds like an escrow fee, this fee is 
		actually charged by the Title Company. Assume it is an income-generating 
		fee similar to some of the lender fees mentioned above.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Loan Tie-in Fee</strong> - Though it sounds like a lender fee, this cost is 
		actually charged by the Escrow Company.<br /><br/>

		<strong>Homeowner’s Association Transfer Fee</strong> - If you are buying a condominium 
		or a home with a Homeowner’s Association, the association often charges 
		a fee to transfer all of their ownership documents to you.<br /><br/>

		<div id="h9">Asking the Seller to Pay Closing Costs - Rules and Advice.</div>
		<br />
		It has become common to ask the seller to pay some or all of the closing 
		costs when you purchase a home. Essentially, this is financing your 
		closing costs since you will probably pay a little bit more for the 
		property than you would if you were paying your own costs.<br /><br/>

		Keep in mind a few simple rules. On conventional loans you can only ask 
		the seller to pay non-recurring costs, not prepaid fees or items to be 
		paid in advance. If you are putting ten percent down or more, the most 
		the seller can contribute is six percent of the purchase price. If you 
		are putting less down, the most the seller can contribute is three 
		percent.<br /><br/>

		On VA loans, you can ask the seller to pay everything. This is called a 
		“VA No-No”, meaning the buyer is making no down payment and paying no 
		closing costs.<br /><br/>

		On FHA loans, the seller can pay almost any cost, but the buyer has to 
		have a minimum three percent investment in the home/closing costs.<br /><br/>

		Most refinances include the closing costs and prepaids in the new loan 
		amount, requiring little or no out-of-pocket expenses to close the deal.<br /><br/>

		If you didn’t get bored as you read through this, now you know 
		everything (almost) about closing costs.</p>
