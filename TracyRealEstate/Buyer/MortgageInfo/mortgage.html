		<div id="h2">FICO® Scores and Your Mortgage</div><br />
		Years ago, credit scoring had little to do with mortgage lending. When 
		reviewing the credit worthiness of a borrower, an underwriter would make 
		a subjective decision based on past payment history.<br /><br />

		Then things changed.<br /><br />

		Lenders studied the relationship between credit scores and mortgage 
		delinquencies. There was a definite relationship. Almost half of those 
		borrowers with FICO® scores below 550 became ninety days delinquent at 
		least once during their mortgage. On the other hand, only two out of 
		every 10,000 borrowers with FICO® scores above eight hundred became 
		delinquent.<br /><br />

		So lenders began to take a closer look at FICO® scores and this is what 
		they found out. The chart below shows the likelihood of a ninety day 
		delinquency for specific FICO® scores.<br /><br />

		<table><tr><td>FICO® Score</td> <td>Odds of a Delinquent Account</td></tr>
		<tr><td>595</td> <td>2 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>600</td> <td>4 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>615</td> <td>9 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>630</td> <td>18 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>645</td> <td>36 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>660</td> <td>72 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>680</td> <td>144 to 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>780</td> <td>576 to 1</td></tr></table><br />

		If you were lending a couple hundred thousand dollars, who would you 
		want to lend it to?<br /><br />

		<div id="h4">FICO® Scores, What Affects Them, How Lenders Look At Them</div>
		<br />
		Imagine a busy lending office and a loan officer has just ordered a 
		credit report. He hears the whir of the laser printer and he knows the 
		pages of the credit report are going to start spitting out in just a 
		second. There is a moment of tension in the air. He watches the pages 
		stack up in the collection tray, but he waits to pick them up until all 
		of the pages are finished printing. He waits because FICO® scores are 
		located at the end of the report. Previously, he would have probably 
		picked them up as they came off. A FICO® above 700 will evoke a smile, 
		then a grin, perhaps a shout and a “victory” style arm pump in the air. 
		A score below 600 will definitely result in a frown, a furrowed brow, 
		and concern.<br /><br />

		FICO® stands for Fair Isaac &amp; Company, and credit scores are reported by 
		each of the three major credit bureaus: TRW (Experian), Equifax, and 
		Trans-Union. The score does not come up exactly the same on each bureau 
		because each bureau places a slightly different emphasis on different 
		items. Scores range from 365 to 840.<br /><br />

		<div id="h5">Some of the things that affect your FICO® scores:</div>
		
		<ul><li>Delinquencies</li>
		<li>Too many accounts opened within the last twelve months</li>
		<li>Short credit history</li>
		<li>Balances on revolving credit are near the maximum limits</li>
		<li>Public records, such as tax liens, judgments, or bankruptcies</li>
		<li>No recent credit card balances</li>
		<li>Too many recent credit inquiries</li>
		<li>Too few revolving accounts</li>
		<li>Too many revolving accounts</li></ul>
		<div id="h6">Sounds confusing, doesn’t it?</div>
		<br />
		The credit score is actually calculated using a scorecard where you 
		receive points for certain things. Creditors and lenders who view your 
		credit report do not get to see the scorecard, so they do not know 
		exactly how your score was calculated. They just see the final scores.<br /><br />

		Basic guidelines on how to view the FICO® scores vary a little from 
		lender to lender. Usually, a score above 680 will require a very basic 
		review of the entire loan package. Scores between 640 and 680 require 
		more thorough underwriting. Once a score gets below 640, an underwriter 
		will look at a loan application with a more cautious approach. Many 
		lenders will not even consider a loan with a FICO® score below 600, some 
		as high as 620.<br /><br />

		<div id="h7">FICO® Scores and Interest Rates</div>
		<br />
		Credit scores can affect more than whether your loan gets approved or 
		not. They can also affect how much you pay for your loan, too. Some 
		lenders establish a base price and will reduce the points on a loan if 
		the credit score is above a certain level. For example, one major 
		national lender reduces the cost of a loan by a quarter point if the 
		FICO® score is greater than 725. If it is between 700 and 724, they will 
		reduce the cost by one-eighth of a point. A point is equal to one 
		percent of the loan amount.<br /><br />

		There are other lenders who do it in reverse. They establish their base 
		price, but instead of reducing the cost for good FICO® scores, they add 
		on costs for lower FICO® scores. The results from either method would 
		work out to be approximately the same interest rate. It is just that the 
		second way looks better when you are quoting interest rates on a rate 
		sheet or in an advertisement.<br /><br />

		<div id="h3">FICO® Scores and Mortgage Underwriting Decisions</div>
		<br />
		<div id="h8">FICO® Scores as Guidelines</div>
		<br />
		FICO® scores are only guidelines and factors other than FICO® scores 
		also affect underwriting decisions. Some examples of compensating 
		factors that will make an underwriter more lenient toward lower FICO® 
		scores can be a larger down payment, low debt-to-income ratios, an 
		excellent history of saving money, and others. There also may be a 
		reasonable explanation for items on the credit history report that 
		negatively impact your credit score.<br /><br />

		<div id="h9">They Don’t Always Make Sense</div>
		<br />
		Even so, sometimes credit scores do not seem to make any sense at all. 
		One borrower with a completely flawless credit history can have a FICO® 
		score below 600. One borrower with a foreclosure on her credit report 
		can have a FICO® above 780.<br /><br />

		<div id="h10">Portfolio &amp; Sub-Prime Lenders</div>
		<br />
		Finally, there are a few portfolio lenders who do not even look at 
		credit scoring, at least on their portfolio loans. A portfolio lender is 
		usually a savings &amp; loan institution that originates some adjustable 
		rate mortgages that they intend to keep in their own portfolio rather 
		than selling them in the secondary mortgage market. These lenders may 
		look at home loans differently. Some concentrate on the value of the 
		home. Some may concentrate more on the savings history of the borrower. 
		There are also sub-prime lenders, or “B &amp; C paper” lenders, who will 
		provide a home loan, but at a higher interest rate and cost.<br /><br />

		<div id="h11">Running Credit Reports</div>
		<br />
		One thing to remember when you are shopping for a home loan is that you 
		should not let numerous mortgage lenders run credit reports on you. Wait 
		until you have a reasonable expectation that they are the lender you are 
		going to use to obtain your home loan. Not only will you have to explain 
		any credit inquiries in the last ninety days, but also numerous 
		inquiries will lower your FICO® score by a small amount. This may not 
		matter if your FICO® is 780, but it would matter if it is 642.<br /><br />

		<div id="h12">Don’t Buy A Car Just Before Looking for a Home!</div>
		<br />
		A word of advice not directly related to FICO® scores. When people begin 
		to think about the possibility of buying a home, they often think about 
		buying other big-ticket items, such as cars. Quite often when someone 
		asks a lender to pre-qualify them for a home loan there is a brand new 
		car payment on the credit report. Often, they would have qualified in 
		their anticipated price range except that the new car payment has raised 
		their debt-to-income ratio, lowering their maximum purchase price. 
		Sometimes they have bought the car so recently that the new loan doesn’t 
		even show up on the credit report yet, but with six to eight credit 
		inquiries from car dealers and automobile finance companies it is kind 
		of obvious. Almost every time you sit down in a car dealership, it 
		generates two inquiries into your credit.<br /><br />

		<div id="h13">Credit History is Important</div>
		<br />
		Nowadays, credit scores are important if you want to get the best 
		interest rate available. Protect your FICO® score. Do not open new 
		revolving accounts needlessly. Do not fill out credit applications 
		needlessly. Do not keep your credit cards nearly maxed out. Make sure 
		you do use your credit occasionally. Always make sure every creditor has 
		their payment in their office no later than 29 days past due.<br /><br />

		And never ever be more than thirty days late on your mortgage. Ever.</p>
