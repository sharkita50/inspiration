		<div id="h2">Which ARM is the Best Alternative?</div><br />

		How would you like a mortgage loan where you did not have to make the 
		whole payment if you did not want to? Or would you like a loan with an 
		interest rate about 1% below a thirty-year fixed rate mortgage and pay 
		zero points? Or a loan where you did not have to document your income, 
		savings history, or source of down payment? How would you like a 
		mortgage payment of only 1.95%? You can have all that with the 11th 
		District Cost of Funds (COFI) Adjustable Rate Mortgage.<br /><br />

		Sound too good to be true? Sound like a bunch of hype?<br /><br />

		Each statement above is true. However, it is also only part of the story 
		and loan officers do not always tell you the whole story when promoting 
		this loan. Other loan officers may try to scare you away from adjustable 
		rate mortgages. However, once you become aware of all the details of the 
		loan, it is an excellent way to buy the house of your dreams, especially 
		when fixed rates begin to go up.<br /><br />

		<div id="h3">ARMs in General</div>
		<br />
		Adjustable rate mortgages all have certain similar features. They have 
		an adjustment period, an index, a margin, and a rate cap. The adjustment 
		period is simply how often the rate changes. Some change monthly, some 
		change every six months, and some only adjust once a year. Indexes are 
		simply an easily monitored interest rate that moves up and down over 
		time. Adjustable rate mortgages have different indexes. The margin is 
		the difference between your interest rate and the index. The margin does 
		not change during the term of the loan.<br /><br />

		So if you have an adjustable rate mortgage and you wanted to calculate 
		your interest rate on your own, all you have to do is look up the index 
		in the paper or on the internet, add the margin, and you have your rate.<br /><br />

		<div id="h4">Indexes and the 11th District</div>
		<br />
		The “Prime Rate” you hear about in the news is one interest rate index, 
		although it is very rare that mortgages are tied to this index. It is 
		more common to find adjustable rate mortgages tied to different treasury 
		bill indexes, the average interest rate paid on certificates of deposit, 
		the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the 11th District Cost of 
		Funds.<br /><br />

		<div id="h5">COFI ARM Index</div>
		<br />
		The 11th District Cost of Funds (COFI) is the weighted average of 
		interest rates paid out on savings deposits by banking institutions in 
		the 11th district of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), which is located 
		in San Francisco. The 11th District includes the states of California, 
		Nevada, and Arizona.<br /><br />

		The COFI index moves slower than the other indexes, making it more 
		stable. It also lags behind actual changes in the interest rate market. 
		For example, when rates begin to go up, the COFI index may continue to 
		decline for a couple of months before it also begins to rise.<br /><br />

		<div id="h6">The Margin and Interest Rates</div>
		<br />
		The margin on the COFI ARM typically ranges between 2.25-3%.<br />
<br />

		<div id="h7">Monthly Adjustments Sound Scary, but...</div>
		<br />
		Although you can get a COFI ARM with an adjustable period of six months, 
		you can get a lower margin if you go for the monthly adjustment period. 
		Since the margin plus the index equals your interest rate, the lower 
		margin is an advantage and most people choose the monthly adjustment.<br /><br />

		Monthly adjustments sound scary to the uninitiated, but keep in mind 
		that this is a slow moving index. Most other ARMS have an annual cap of 
		2% a year. Since 1981, when the FHLB began tracking the index, the most 
		it has moved during any calendar year is 1.6%. So why get a higher 
		margin just to get a rate cap that you probably will not use anyway?<br /><br />

		The“life-of-loan” cap for the COFI ARM is usually 11.95%. The most 
		recent year that this cap could have been reached was 1985. Plus, most 
		experts do not expect a return to the interest rates of the early 1980’s 
		when interest rates were pushed up artificially to combat the inflation 
		of the 1970’s.<br /><br />

		<div id="h8">Make Only Part of Your Payment?</div>
		<br />
		This is the really interesting feature of the loan. You do not have to 
		make the whole payment. Each month you get a bill that has at least 
		three payment options. One choice is the full payment at the current 
		interest rate. A second choice allows you to pay only the interest that 
		is due on the loan that particular month, but does not pay anything 
		towards the principal. Finally, the third option gives you the choice to 
		pay even less than that and is called the “minimum payment.”<br /><br />

		The minimum payment when you start your loan can be calculated as low as 
		1.95%. Keep in mind that this is not the note rate on your loan, but 
		just a way to calculate your minimum payment.<br /><br />

		<div id="h9">Deferred Interest and Amortization</div>
		<br />
		Of course, if you only make the minimum payment each month, you are not 
		paying all of the interest that is currently due that month. You are 
		deferring some of the interest that is currently due on the loan so you 
		will have to pay it later. The lender keeps track of this deferred 
		interest by adding it to the loan and the loan balance gets larger. 
		Neither you nor the lender wants this to continue forever, so your 
		minimum payment increases a bit each year.<br /><br />

		The payment cap on the loan is 7.5%, which also has nothing to do with 
		the interest rate. All it means is the most your minimum payment can 
		increase from one year to the next is seven and a half percent. For 
		example, if your minimum payment is $1000 this year, next year the most 
		it could be is $1075. This continues each year until your payment is 
		approximately equal to the payment at the full note rate.<br /><br />

		Just in case, there are fail-safes built into the loan. If you continue 
		making only the minimum payment and your current balance ever reaches 
		110% of the beginning balance, the loan is re-amortized to make sure you 
		pay it off in thirty years (or forty years, whichever option you chose). 
		Every five years the loan is re-amortized to make sure it pays off 
		within the term of the loan.<br /><br />

		<div id="h10">Stated Income and Other Features</div>
		<br />
		Many COFI lenders allow Homebuyers with good credit to apply without 
		documenting their income, assets, or source of down payment. Of course, 
		you have to make a twenty or twenty-five percent down payment on your 
		home purchase. This is helpful for self-employed borrowers or those who 
		have jobs where it is difficult to document their income. Plus, some 
		people just do not like the bother of supplying W2 forms, tax returns 
		and pay-stubs. Anyway, it makes for a quick and easy loan approval.<br /><br />

		<div id="h11">Sub-Prime COFI ARMs</div>
		<br />
		Some people have less than perfect credit and they are used to being 
		charged outrageous rates for past problems. Some COFI lenders offer this 
		same loan but have a slightly higher starting payment and a higher 
		margin. The end result is that your interest rate would be about one 
		percent higher.<br /><br />

		<div id="h12">Who Should Get This Loan?</div>
		<br />
		Most people who get the COFI ARM are purchasing a home between $300,000 
		and $650,000, but it is not limited to that. It is a real favorite of 
		those working in the financial industry and those with higher incomes. 
		One reason these groups like this particular loan is because they 
		consider any deferred interest to be an extended loan at a very 
		attractive rate. By making the minimum payment, they can do other things 
		with the money.<br /><br />

		Homebuyers whose income has peaks and valleys, such as self-employed or 
		commissioned salespeople also like the loan, because it provides 
		flexibility in the monthly payment. During a slow month they can make 
		the minimum payment if they choose.<br /><br />

		Another reason borrowers like the loan is because it allows for tax 
		planning. The borrower can defer interest payments and at the end of the 
		year, analyze their tax situation. If it serves their tax interests, 
		they can make a lump sum payment toward any interest that has been 
		deferred and deduct it for tax purposes.<br /><br />

		<div id="h13">Skipping the Starter Home or Move-Up Home</div>
		<br />
		If you’re buying a home with the intention of living in it for only a 
		few years before you move up to a bigger home, the COFI ARM makes sense, 
		too. With this loan and its low start payment you can often qualify for 
		a larger home than you can when applying for a fixed rate loan. This 
		allows you to skip the intermediate purchase and move up immediately to 
		the home you really want, which makes more sense and saves you money.<br /><br />

		If you buy a home then sell it to move up to a bigger home, you are 
		going to have to pay a Realtor’s commissions and closing costs. On a 
		$300,000 house, this would be around $25,000. If you skip buying that 
		home and buy the home you really want, you save that money. Plus, you 
		save money in another way. Say you live in your intermediate purchase 
		for five years, then move up and buy another home with another 
		thirty-year mortgage. That is thirty-five years of home loans. If you 
		buy your ideal home now, you save five years of mortgage payments. 
		Depending on your loan amount, that can be a lot of cash.<br /><br />

		<div id="h14">Conclusion</div>
		<br />
		So, when rates start going up this is an attractive alternative to a 
		fixed rate mortgage. It even makes sense for some borrowers when rates 
		are low. Something we also did not mention is that most COFI lenders 
		also give you a fourth option on your monthly mortgage statement, which 
		allows you to pay it off quicker.<br />
