<br />
		<div id="h2">Types of Mortgage Lenders</div><br />
		<div id="h3">Mortgage Bankers</div>
		<br />
		Mortgage Bankers are lenders that are large enough to originate loans 
		and create pools of loans, which are then sold directly to Fannie Mae, 
		Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, jumbo loan investors, and others. Any company 
		that does this is considered to be a mortgage banker.<br /><br />

		Some companies don’t sell directly to those major investors, but sell 
		their loans to the mortgage bankers. They often refer to themselves as 
		mortgage bankers as well. Since they are actually engaging in the 
		selling of loans, there is some justification for using this label. The 
		point is that you cannot reliably determine the size or strength of a 
		particular lender based on whether or not they identify themselves as a 
		mortgage banker.<br /><br />

		<div id="h4">Portfolio Lenders</div>
		<br />
		An institution that lends their own money and originates loans for 
		itself is called a portfolio lender. This is because they are lending 
		for their own portfolio of loans and not worried about being able to 
		immediately sell them on the secondary market. Because of this, they 
		don’t have to obey Fannie/Freddie guidelines and can create their own 
		rules for determining credit worthiness. Usually these institutions are 
		larger banks and savings &amp; loans.<br /><br />

		Quite often only a portion of their loan programs are a portfolio 
		product. If they are offering fixed rate loans or government loans, they 
		are certainly engaging in mortgage banking as well as portfolio lending.<br /><br />

		Once a borrower has made the payments on a portfolio loan for over a 
		year without any late payments, the loan is considered seasoned. Once a 
		loan has a track history of timely payments it becomes marketable, even 
		if it does not meet Freddie/Fannie guidelines.<br /><br />

		Selling these seasoned loans frees up more money for the portfolio 
		lender to make additional loans. If they are sold, they are packaged 
		into pools and sold on the secondary market. You will probably not even 
		realize your loan is sold because, quite likely, you will still make 
		your loan payments to the same lender, which has now become your 
		servicer.<br /><br />

		<div id="h5">Direct Lenders</div>
		<br />
		Lenders are considered to be direct lenders if they fund their own 
		loans. A direct lender can range anywhere from the biggest lender to a 
		very tiny one. Banks and savings &amp; loans obviously have deposits with 
		which they can fund loans, but they usually use warehouse lines of 
		credit for drawing the money to fund the loans. Smaller institutions 
		also have warehouse lines of credit from which they draw money to fund 
		loans.<br /><br />

		Direct lenders usually fit into the category of mortgage bankers or 
		portfolio lenders, but not always.<br /><br />

		<div id="h6">Correspondents</div>
		<br />
		Correspondent is usually a term that refers to a company that originates 
		and closes home loans in their own name, then sells them individually to 
		a larger lender, called a sponsor. The sponsor acts as the mortgage 
		banker, re-selling the loan to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac as 
		part of a pool. The correspondent may fund the loans themselves or 
		funding may take place from the larger company. Either way, the sponsor 
		usually underwrites the loan.<br /><br />

		It is almost like being a mortgage broker, except that there is usually 
		a very strong relationship between the correspondent and their sponsor.<br /><br />
		<div id="h7">Mortgage Brokers</div>

		<br />
		Mortgage Brokers are companies that originate loans with the intention 
		of brokering them to lending institutions. A broker has established 
		relationships with these companies. Underwriting and funding takes place 
		at the larger institutions. Many mortgage brokers are also 
		correspondents.<br /><br />

		Mortgage brokers deal with lending institutions that have a wholesale 
		loan department.<br /><br />

		<div id="h8">Wholesale Lenders</div>
		<br />
		Most mortgage bankers and portfolio lenders also act as wholesale 
		lenders, catering to mortgage brokers for loan origination. Some 
		wholesale lenders do not even have their own retail branches, relying 
		solely on mortgage brokers for their loans. These wholesale divisions 
		offer loans to mortgage brokers at a lower cost than their retail 
		branches offer them to the general public. The mortgage broker then adds 
		on his fee. The result for the borrower is that the loan costs about the 
		same as if he obtained a loan directly from a retail branch of the 
		wholesale lender.<br /><br />

		<strong>Banks and savings &amp; loans</strong> usually operate as portfolio lenders, mortgage 
		bankers, or some combination of both.<br /><br />

		<strong>Credit Unions</strong> usually seem to operate as correspondents, although a 
		large one could act as a portfolio lender or a mortgage banker.<br />
