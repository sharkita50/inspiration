		<div id="h2">The Advantages of Different Types of Mortgage Lenders</div><br />

		What kind of lender is best?<br />
		<br />
		If you ask a loan officer, “What kind of lender is best?” the answer 
		will be whatever kind of company he works for and he will give you a 
		list of reasons why. If you meet the same loan officer years later, and 
		he works for a different kind of lender, he will give you a list of 
		reasons why that type of lender is better.<br /><br />

		Realtors will also have differing opinions, and those opinions have and 
		will continue to change over time. In the past, it seemed like most 
		would recommend portfolio lenders. Now, they usually recommend mortgage 
		bankers and mortgage brokers. Most often they direct you to a specific 
		loan officer who has demonstrated a track record of service and 
		reliability.<br /><br />

		This article discusses the advantages and disadvantage of different 
		types of institutions, not the individual loan officers. However, it is 
		often more important to choose the correct loan officer, not the 
		institution. The loan officer has many responsibilities, one of which is 
		to act as your representative and advocate to the lender he works for or 
		the institutions he brokers loans to. You want someone who has proven 
		dependable and ethical in the past.<br /><br />

		Regarding the institutions, the truth of the matter is that each type of 
		lender has strengths and weaknesses. This does not even take into 
		account the variety of other factors that influence whether a lender is 
		good or bad. Quality can vary, depending on the loan officer, the 
		support staff, which branch or office you are obtaining your loan from, 
		and a variety of other factors.<br /><br />

		<div id="h4">PORTFOLIO LENDERS</div>
		<br />
		Savings &amp; Loans are quite often portfolio lenders, as are some banks. 
		Portfolio lenders generally promote their own portfolio loans, which are 
		usually adjustable rate loans. They will often pay more compensation to 
		their loan officers for originating a portfolio product than for 
		originating a fixed rate loan. You may also find that they are not as 
		competitive as mortgage bankers and brokers in the fixed rate loan 
		market.<br /><br />

		However, it is often easier to qualify for a portfolio loan, so 
		borrowers who may not qualify for a fixed rate loan may be able to 
		obtain a loan from a portfolio lender. A borrower may be able to qualify 
		for a larger loan from a portfolio lender than he could obtain from a 
		fixed rate lender.<br /><br />

		Portfolio lenders also can serve as niche lenders because certain things 
		are more important to them than meeting the more standardized 
		underwriting guidelines of a mortgage banker. An example would be a 
		savings &amp; loan, which is more concerned with an individual’s savings 
		history than being able to fully document income and other things.<br /><br />

		If you apply for a loan with a portfolio lender and you are declined, 
		you usually have to start the process over with a new company.<br /><br />
		<div id="h5">MORTGAGE BANKERS</div><br />
If we are talking about the larger mortgage bankers, you can count on 
		them having several strengths. For the biggest ones, you will recognize 
		the brand name.<br /><br />

		Usually, they are much better at promoting special first time buyer 
		programs offered by states and local governments, that have lower 
		interest rates and costs than the current market rate. These programs 
		are often available to buyers who have not owned a home in the last 
		three years and fall within certain income guidelines.<br /><br />

		Mortgage bankers may incur problems because they are just too big to 
		manage, or they may operate like well-oiled machines.<br /><br />

		If you are buying a home and you need a VA or FHA loan and the 
		development you are buying in has not yet been approved, they will be 
		better at getting it approved than other lenders.<br /><br />

		If your home loan is declined for some reason, many mortgage bankers 
		allow their loan officers to broker the loan to another institution. 
		However, because your loan officer is so used to promoting the company’s 
		product, he may not be familiar with which institution may be the best 
		one to submit your loan to. Another reason is because wholesale lenders 
		do not expect to get many loans from direct mortgage bankers, so they do 
		not expend much marketing effort on them.<br /><br />

		<div id="h6">BANKS and SAVINGS &amp; LOANS</div>
		<br />
		Their major strength is that you will recognize their name. In addition, 
		they will usually be operating as a mortgage banker, a portfolio lender, 
		or both, and have the same weaknesses and strengths.<br /><br />

		<div id="h7">MORTGAGE BROKERS</div>
		<br />
		The major strength of mortgage brokers is that they can shop the 
		wholesale lenders for the best rate much easier than a borrower can. 
		They also learn the “hot points” of certain wholesale lenders and can 
		handpick the lender for a borrower that may be unique in some way. He 
		will be able to advise you whether your loan should be submitted to a 
		portfolio lender or a mortgage banker. Another advantage is that, if a 
		loan gets declined for some reason, they can simply repackage the loan 
		and submit it to another wholesale lender.<br /><br />

		One additional advantage is that mortgage brokers tend to attract a high 
		number of the most qualified loan officers. This is not universal 
		because mortgage brokers also serve as the training ground for those 
		just entering the business. If you have a new loan officer and there is 
		something unique about you or the property you are buying, there could 
		be a problem on the horizon that an experienced loan officer would have 
		anticipated.<br /><br />

		A disadvantage is that mortgage brokers sometimes attract the greediest 
		loan officers, too. They may charge you more on your loan, which would 
		then nullify the ability of the mortgage broker being able to shop for 
		the lowest rate.<br /><br />

		<div id="h8">WHOLESALE LENDERS</div>
		<br />
		Borrowers cannot get access to the wholesale divisions of mortgage 
		bankers and portfolio lenders without going through a broker.<br /><br />

		<div id="h3">When Realtors or Builders Recommend a Lender</div>
		<br />
		If your Realtor or builder makes a suggestion for a lender, be sure to 
		talk to that lender. One reason Realtors and builders make suggestions 
		is the fact that they have regular dealings with this lender and have 
		come to expect a certain amount of reliability. Reliability is extremely 
		important to all parties involved in a real estate transaction.<br /><br />

		On the other hand, a recent trend in mortgage lending has been for real 
		estate companies and builders to own their own mortgage companies or 
		create “controlled business arrangements” (CBA’s) in order to increase 
		their profitability. These mortgage brokers sometimes become used to 
		having what is essentially a captured market and may not necessarily 
		offer you the lowest rates or costs.<br /><br />

		Some real estate companies also offer different types of incentives to 
		their Realtors in exchange for recommending their company-owned mortgage 
		and escrow companies or lenders with whom they have CBA’s. Dealing with 
		one of these lenders is not necessarily a bad thing, though. The builder 
		or real estate company often feels they have more ability to expedite 
		matters when they own the company or have a controlled business 
		relationship. They cannot usually influence the underwriting decision, 
		but they can sometimes cut through red tape to handle problems or speed 
		up the process. Builders are especially forceful on having you use their 
		lender. One reason is that there are certain intricacies in dealing with 
		new homes. If you use a loan officer who usually deals with refinances 
		or resale home loans, he may not even be aware of how different it is to 
		close a mortgage on a new home and this can lead to problems or delays.<br /><br />

		It is in your interest to know if there is any kind of ownership 
		relationship or controlled business arrangement between the real estate 
		or builder and the lender, so be sure to ask. Do not automatically 
		disqualify such a lender, but be sure to be more vigilant on getting the 
		best interest rate and the lowest costs.<br /><br />

		<div id="h9">Conclusion</div>
		<br />
		Make sure to do a little shopping. By knowing the interest rates in your 
		market and making sure your loan officer knows you are looking at rates 
		from other institutions, you can use that as leverage to make sure you 
		are obtaining the best combination of service and the lowest rates.<br />
