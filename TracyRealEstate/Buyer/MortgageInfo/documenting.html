		<div id="h2">Documenting Your Assets - Verifying Your Down Payment</div><br />
		When buying a home, it is not enough to just come up with the money. 
		With the exception of no asset verification loans, lenders want to 
		verify where the money for your new home will be coming from. If you can 
		document that the funds are coming from your personal savings, the 
		lender is more confident of your strength as a borrower.<br /><br />
		In addition, if you can verify that you have additional assets that are 
		not needed for the down payment, it is important to document those, too. 
		Additional assets are reserves you can draw upon during times of 
		trouble, such as unemployment, medical emergencies, and similar 
		occurrences. Additional assets can also help to document that you have a 
		history of saving money, which makes you a more dependable borrower.<br /><br />
		It is extremely important to completely document the paper trail of any 
		funds you use for down payment and closing costs. The sections below 
		provide guidance on both verifying assets and documenting them as a 
		source of your down payment.<br /><br />
		<div id="h3">Checking, Savings, &amp; Money Market Accounts</div>
		<br />
		The quickest and easiest way to document funds in your bank account is 
		to provide your lender with copies of your most recent bank statements. 
		Most lenders request two months of bank statements, but some still ask 
		for three. Some lenders still send a Verification of Deposit to your 
		bank in order to determine your current bank balances and average 
		balance for the last two months. However, that is the old way of doing 
		business and most lenders nowadays prefer to have bank statements.<br /><br />
		If the money you are using for the down payment and closing costs has 
		been in the bank for the entire period covered by the bank statements, 
		you’re fine. These are known as “seasoned funds.” However, if your 
		statements show any large or unusual deposits, the lender will ask you 
		to explain them and document their source.<br /><br />
		<div id="h4">Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, etc.</div>
		<br />
		Most of those who own stocks get a monthly or quarterly statement from 
		their brokerage. You will need to supply statements for the most recent 
		sixty or ninety days in order to document these assets.<br /><br />
		Though it is rare nowadays, some people actually have stock certificates 
		instead of having a brokerage account. When this is the situation, make 
		copies of the certificates and provide those copies to your lender. You 
		might also want to supply tax records to indicate you have owned these 
		stocks for some time.<br /><br />
		If part of your down payment will come from the sale of stocks and 
		investments, you will need to keep all documentation that applies to the 
		sale. Provide these copies to your lender as well.<br /><br />
		<div id="h5">Gifts</div>
		<br />
		Especially when buying a first home, some borrowers need help coming up 
		with the down payment. This help should come in the form of a gift from 
		a close family member. Lenders will require the donors to sign a special 
		form called a gift letter. The gift letter states the relationship 
		between the parties, the address of the purchased property, the amount 
		of the gift, and sometimes the source of the funds used to make the 
		gift. The gift letter also clearly states that the funds are a gift and 
		not required to be repaid.<br /><br />
		With most lenders, the donor will have to also provide evidence that 
		they have the ability to make the gift. This can be in the form of a 
		bank or stock statement to show they have the funds available. You 
		should also make a copy of the check used to make the gift and keep a 
		copy of the deposit receipt when you deposit the gift funds into your 
		bank account or escrow.<br /><br />
		<div id="h6">401K or Retirement Accounts</div>
		<br />
		It is important to provide documentation about your retirement accounts 
		or 401K programs because this is another asset you could draw upon as 
		reserves in case of a problem. It is also another way to show you have a 
		savings history. Just provide a copy of your most recent statement to 
		your lender.<br /><br />
		Many people use these accounts as a source of funds for their down 
		payment, too. Some employers allow you to cash out a portion of the 401K 
		and some allow you to borrow against it. Be sure to keep copies of all 
		paperwork involving the transaction. If they cut you a check, be sure to 
		make a photocopy of that, too, including any receipt for deposit into 
		your personal bank account.<br /><br />
		If you are borrowing against your 401K, some lenders will count this as 
		an additional debt to go along with car payments, credit cards and other 
		obligations. This may seem kind of silly because you are borrowing your 
		own money, but from the lender’s viewpoint it is still a monthly 
		obligation that you must come up with and should be taken into account. 
		If you are tight on your debt-to-income ratios in qualifying for a home 
		loan, this could be an important consideration. It may affect whether 
		you choose to cash out the account and pay any tax penalty, or simply 
		borrow against it.<br /><br />
		<div id="h7">Employers</div>
		<br />
		Some companies provide down payment assistance for their employees. They 
		may feel that Homeowners are more stable and reliable employees, or that 
		providing down payment assistance fosters an environment of higher 
		morale and loyalty to the firm. Just make copies of all the paperwork, 
		including a copy of the check and the receipt when you deposit the funds 
		into your personal bank account. It is important that these funds do not 
		require repayment.<br /><br />
		<div id="h8">Savings Bonds</div>
		<br />
		If you have Savings Bonds, remember that they are also financial assets. 
		Since you hold the actual bonds in your possession, the easiest and best 
		way to verify them for your mortgage lender is to make photocopies of 
		them. If you choose to cash them in for down payment or closing costs, 
		you should do this at your local bank. Be sure to keep copies of the 
		paperwork the bank provides because that will establish the current 
		value of the bonds and show that you received their cash value.<br /><br />
		<div id="h9">Personal Property - Cars, Antiques, etc.</div>
		<br />
		Personal property includes automobiles, vehicles, boats, furniture, 
		collections, heirlooms, antiques, art, clothing, and practically 
		everything you own except for real estate. The mortgage application asks 
		you to estimate the value of these items.<br /><br />
		The larger the loan amount, the more important it is for you to provide 
		details on your personal property. This is because larger loans usually 
		indicate larger incomes, and lenders check to see if your personal 
		property matches your income. If it does not, this sends a red flag to 
		the underwriter and they take a closer look at your application.<br /><br />
		You are not required to document the value of personal property unless 
		you intend to sell them to come up with your down payment.<br /><br />
		<div id="h10">Selling Personal Property</div>
		<br />
		For those Homebuyers who do sell personal property in order to come up 
		with their down payment, the verification process can be arduous. 
		Lenders are much stricter about documenting this method of coming up 
		with your source of funds.<br /><br />
		Selling a car is perhaps the easiest to document. First, you need to 
		photocopy the registration that shows you actually own the vehicle. You 
		will have to provide a copy of the page in the “Blue Book” that shows 
		your model and its value. Then you need to photocopy the bill of sale 
		showing the transfer to another individual and a copy of the check used 
		to purchase the vehicle. Do not get paid in cash because that makes it 
		impossible to show you actually received the funds. Make a copy of the 
		receipt when you deposit the funds into the bank.<br /><br />
		Other types of personal property are more difficult because you have to 
		show that you actually own the property and that it actually has the 
		value that you sold it for. This is a little harder to do for most 
		assets than it is for automobiles.<br /><br />
		Records showing you purchased the property would be helpful. You could 
		also provide an old inventory that documents ownership. To determine 
		value, you may have to contract with an independent appraiser or a 
		specialist who has the knowledge for that particular type of property.<br /><br />
		If you cannot document the item’s value, the lender will not view the 
		sale as an acceptable source of funds. Just like selling a car, you have 
		to prove you own the item, make a copy of the bill of sale, copy the 
		check used to purchase the item, and make a copy of your receipt when 
		you deposit the funds into your bank.</p>
