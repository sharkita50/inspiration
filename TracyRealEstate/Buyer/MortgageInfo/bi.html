		<div id="h2">The Biweekly Mortgage - Who Needs It?</div><br />

		Have you received an advertisement offering to save you thousands of 
		dollars on your thirty-year mortgage and cut years off your payments? 
		With email spam becoming more pervasive as everyone tries to get rich 
		quick on the Internet, these ads are popping up with troublesome 
		regularity.<br /><br />

		The ads promote a Biweekly Mortgage and for the most part, do not come 
		from a mortgage lender. Exclamation points punctuate practically every 
		claim:
		<ul><li>No closing costs!</li>
		<li>No refinancing!</li>
		<li>No points!</li>
		<li>No credit check!</li>
		<li>No appraisal!</li>
		<li>Save thousands!</li>
		<li>Cut years off your mortgage!</li></ul>
		To achieve these wonderful savings all you have to do is allow half of 
		your mortgage payment to be deducted from your checking account every 
		two weeks. It’s easy. Of course, there is a small set-up fee and usually 
		a transaction fee with every automatic deduction.<br /><br />

		Essentially, the ads are truthful in almost every respect.<br /><br />

		They just want to charge you money for something you can do on your own 
		for free.<br /><br />

		<div id="h3">The Basics:</div>
		<br />
		Normally, you make twelve mortgage payments a year. Since there are 
		fifty-two weeks in a year, a biweekly mortgage equals 26 half-payments a 
		year. The equivalent would be making thirteen mortgage payments a year 
		instead of twelve. By applying that extra payment directly to the loan 
		balance as a principal reduction, your loan amortizes more quickly, 
		requiring fewer payments.<br /><br />

		You save money. The ads are true.<br /><br />

		<div id="h4">How it Actually Works:</div>
		<br />
		You cannot simply mail in half a payment every two weeks to your 
		mortgage lender. Since they do not accept partial payments for legal and 
		accounting reasons, the mortgage company would just mail your 
		half-payment back to you.<br /><br />

		Instead, the biweekly mortgage company is an intermediary between you 
		and your mortgage lender. They automatically debit your checking account 
		every two weeks for half of your mortgage payment then place your funds 
		into a trust account. Basically, this is just a holding account for your 
		money. In another two weeks, there is another automatic deduction from 
		your checking account, and so on. When your mortgage payment is due, 
		your funds are withdrawn from the trust account and forwarded to your 
		mortgage lender.<br /><br />

		Since you are placing funds into the trust account faster than your 
		mortgage payments are due, you eventually accumulate enough money to 
		make an extra payment. The way the cycle works, this occurs once a year. 
		he extra payment is applied directly to your principal balance, which 
		causes your loan to amortize faster, pay off more quickly and save you 
		thousands of dollars.<br /><br />

		<div id="h5">Potential Problems with the Trust Account</div>
		<br />
		Because your funds are held in the trust account until your mortgage 
		payment is due, there are potential dangers. Not only are your funds 
		held in this account, but so are the funds of everyone else enrolled in 
		the biweekly program. That is a lot of money.<br /><br />

		Most likely, there will be no problems.<br /><br />

		However, if there are accounting errors, mismanagement, or even fraud, 
		your mortgage payment might not get made. The first hint of a problem 
		will probably be a phone call or letter from your mortgage lender, but 
		not until after your payment is already late. Since responsibility for 
		making the payment rests with you and not the biweekly payment company, 
		you may find yourself digging into your personal savings to make the 
		payment directly -- even though the biweekly payment company has already 
		collected your funds.<br /><br />

		Later you can work out the trust account problem with your biweekly 
		payment company.<br /><br />

		<div id="h6">The Cost of the Biweekly Mortgage</div>
		<br />
		There is usually a set-up fee that runs between $195 and $350, depending 
		on how much sales commission is paid to the individual or company 
		setting up the account for you. You also pay a transaction fee each time 
		there is an automatic deduction from your checking account and sometimes 
		also when the payment is made to your mortgage lender. There may also be 
		a periodic maintenance fee.<br /><br />

		Meanwhile, whoever controls the trust account is earning interest on 
		your money.<br /><br />

		<div id="h7">Savings of the Biweekly Mortgage</div>
		<br />
		By making principal reductions using the biweekly mortgage program, your 
		mortgage will amortize more quickly, saving you money. How quickly your 
		loan pays off depends on your interest rate and when you begin making 
		the biweekly payments.<br /><br />

		On a $100,000 loan at an interest rate of eight percent, your first 
		principal reduction would probably be a year from now. Assuming the 
		principal reduction is equal to one monthly payment ($733.76), you would 
		save $43,852 over the life of the loan and pay it off almost seven years 
		early.<br /><br />

		However, you have to deduct from those savings any amounts you paid in 
		set-up, transaction, and maintenance fees.<br /><br />

		<div id="h8">No-Cost Alternatives to the Biweekly Mortgage</div>
		<br />
		Instead of hiring a company to manage your biweekly payment, you could 
		accomplish essentially the same thing on your own for free. Just take 
		your monthly payment, divide it by twelve, and add that amount to your 
		monthly mortgage payment. Be sure to earmark it as a principal 
		reduction.<br /><br />

		The first way you save is that you do not have to pay any fees to 
		anyone. It’s free.<br /><br />

		In addition to not paying fees -- using the same example as above -- 
		your total savings on the mortgage would be $45,904. Plus the loan would 
		be paid off three months quicker than with the biweekly mortgage. The 
		reason you save more is because you are making a principal reduction 
		each month, instead of waiting for funds to accumulate so that you can 
		make one principal reduction a year.<br /><br />

		<div id="h9">Self-Discipline?</div>
		<br />
		The biweekly mortgage companies claim that homeowners are not 
		disciplined enough to follow through with principal reduction plans on 
		their own. They suggest the reason for setting up the biweekly mortgage 
		enforces discipline upon you, and by doing so, they save you money.<br /><br />

		However, in this technologically advanced age, banking online and 
		automatic deductions are readily available. You can set up your own 
		automatic deductions including the additional principal reduction and 
		have it go directly to your mortgage lender. Since the deduction occurs 
		automatically, just like with the biweekly mortgages, self-discipline is 
		not a problem. Once again, you don’t have to pay anyone to do it for you 
		and you save even more money.<br /><br />

		<div id="h10">Conclusion</div>
		<br />
		The biweekly mortgage plans do not really do anything except move your 
		money around and charge you for it. Plus, even though the danger is 
		negligible, you must trust someone else to hold your money for you. If 
		you can do the very same thing for free, plus save yourself even more 
		money by doing it on your own, why pay someone else?<br /><br />

		The biweekly mortgage plan - who needs it?<br /><br />

		If your goal is principal reduction and saving money, then it is a good 
		plan. If you do it on your own instead of paying someone else to do it 
		for you, then it is a great plan.<br /><br />
