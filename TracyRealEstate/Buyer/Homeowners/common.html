		<div id="h2">Common Ways of Holding Title</div><br />
		How Should I Take Ownership of the Property I am Buying?<br /><br />

		Real property can be incredibly valuable and the question of how parties 
		can take ownership of their property is important. The form of ownership 
		taken -- the vesting of title -- will determine who may sign various 
		documents involving the property and future rights of the parties to the 
		transaction. These rights involve such matters as: real property taxes, 
		income taxes, inheritance and gift taxes, transferability of title and 
		exposure to creditor’s claims. Also, how title is vested can have 
		significant probate implications in the event of death.<br /><br />

		The Land Title Association (LTA) advises those purchasing real property 
		to give careful consideration to the manner in which title will be held. 
		Buyers may wish to consult legal counsel to determine the most 
		advantageous form of ownership for their particular situation, 
		especially in cases of multiple owners of a single property.<br /><br />

		The LTA has provided the following definitions of common vesting as an 
		informational overview. Consumers should not rely on these as legal 
		definitions. The Association urges real property purchasers to carefully 
		consider their titling decision prior to closing, and to seek counsel 
		should they be unfamiliar with the most suitable ownership choice for 
		their particular situation.<br /><br />

		Common Methods of Holding Title<br /><br />

		<div id="h3">SOLE OWNERSHIP</div><br />
		
		Sole ownership may be described as ownership by an individual or other 
		entity capable of acquiring title. Examples of common vesting in cases 
		of sole ownership are:<br />
		<ol><li>A Single Man/Woman:<br />
		A man or woman who has not been legally married. For example: Bruce 
		Buyer, a single man.</li>
		<li>An Unmarried Man/Woman:<br />
		A man or woman who was previously married and is now legally divorced. 
		For example: Sally Seller, an unmarried woman.</li>
		<li>A Married Man/Woman as His/Her Sole and Separate Property:<br />
		A married man or woman who wishes to acquire title in his or her name 
		alone.</li></ol><br />
		The title company insuring title will require the spouse of the married 
		man or woman acquiring title to specifically disclaim or relinquish his 
		or her right, title and interest to the property. This establishes that 
		it is the desire of both spouses that title to the property be granted 
		to one spouse as that spouse’s sole and separate property. For example: 
		Bruce Buyer, a married man, as his sole and separate property.<br /><br />

		<div id="h4">CO-OWNERSHIP</div><br />
		
		Title to property owned by two or more persons may be vested in the 
		following forms:<br />
		<ol><li>Community Property:<br />
		A form of vesting title to property owned by husband and wife during 
		their marriage, which they intend to own together. Community property is 
		distinguished from separate property, which is property acquired before 
		marriage, by separate gift or bequest, after legal separation, or which 
		is agreed to be owned only by one spouse.<br /><br />

		Real property conveyed to a married man or woman is presumed to be 
		community property, unless otherwise stated. Since all such property is 
		owned equally, husband and wife must sign all agreements and documents 
		of transfer. Under community property, either spouse has the right to 
		dispose of one half of the community property, including transfers by 
		will. For example: Bruce Buyer and Barbara Buyer, husband and wife as 
		community property.</li><br />
<br />

		
		<li>Joint Tenancy<br />
		A form of vesting title to property owned by two or more persons, who 
		may or may not be married, in equal interest, subject to the right of 
		survivorship in the surviving joint tenant(s). Title must have been 
		acquired at the same time, by the same conveyance, and the document must 
		expressly declare the intention to create a joint tenancy estate. When a 
		joint tenant dies, title to the property is automatically conveyed by 
		operation of law to the surviving joint tenant(s). Therefore, joint 
		tenancy property is not subject to disposition by will. For example: 
		Bruce Buyer and Barbara Buyer, husband and wife as joint tenants.</li><br /><br />


		
		<li>Tenancy in Common:<br />
		A form of vesting title to property owned by any two or more individuals 
		in undivided fractional interests. These fractional interests may be 
		unequal in quantity or duration and may arise at different times. Each 
		tenant in common owns a share of the property, is entitled to a 
		comparable portion of the income from the property and must bear an 
		equivalent share of expenses. Each co-tenant may sell, lease or will to 
		his/her heir that share of the property belonging to him/her. For 
		example: Bruce Buyer, a single man, as to an undivided 3/4 interest and 
		Penny Purchaser, a single woman, as to an undivided 1/4 interest, as 
		tenants in common.</li></ol>

		Other ways of vesting title include:<br />
		<ol><li>A Corporation*:<br />
		A corporation is a legal entity, created under state law, consisting of 
		one or more shareholders but regarded under law as having an existence 
		and personality separate from such shareholders.</li>
		<li>A Partnership*:<br />
		A partnership is an association of two or more persons who can carry on 
		business for profit as co-owners, as governed by the Uniform Partnership 
		Act. A partnership may hold title to real property in the name of the 
		partnership.</li><br />
<br />

		<li>As Trustees of A Trust*:<br />
		A trust is an arrangement whereby legal title to a property is 
		transferred by the grantor to a person called a trustee, to be held and 
		managed by that person for the benefit of the people specified in the 
		trust agreement, called the beneficiaries.</li><br /><br />


		<li>Limited Liability Companies (L.L.C.)<br />
		This form of ownership is a legal entity and is similar to both the 
		corporation and the partnership. The operating agreement will determine 
		how the L.L.C. functions and is taxed. Like the corporation its 
		existence is separate from its owners.</li></ol>
				*In cases of corporate, partnership, L.L.C. or trust ownership - 
		required documents may include corporate articles and bylaws, 
		partnership agreements, L.L.C. operating agreement and trust agreements 
		and/or certificates.<br /><br />

		Remember:<br /><br />

		How title is vested has important legal consequences. You may wish to 
		consult an attorney to determine the most advantageous form of ownership 
		for your particular situation.<br /><br />
