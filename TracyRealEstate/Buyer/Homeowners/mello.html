		<div id="h2">Mello-Roos</div><br /><br />
		In purchasing your new home, your future monthly payments will be made 
		up of principal, interest, real property taxes, and insurance. But what 
		is the tax for the Community Facilities District, otherwise known as a 
		Mello-Roos District? The Land Title Association (LTA) has answered some 
		of the most commonly asked questions about the Mello-Roos Community 
		Facilities Act.<br /><br />
		What is a Mello-Roos District?<br /><br />
		A Mello-Roos District is an area where a special tax is imposed on those 
		real property owners within a Community Facilities District. This 
		district has chosen to seek public financing through the sale of bonds 
		for the purpose of financing certain public improvements and services. 
		These services may include streets, water, sewage and drainage, 
		electricity, infrastructure, schools, parks and police protection to 
		newly developing areas. The tax you pay is used to make the payments of 
		principal and interest on the bonds.<br /><br />
		Are the assessments included within the Proposition 13 tax limits?<br /><br />
		No. The passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 severely restricted local 
		government in its ability to finance public capital facilities and 
		services by increasing real property taxes. The “Mello-Roos Community 
		Facilities Act of 1982” provided local government with an additional 
		financing tool. The Proposition 13 tax limits are on the value of the 
		real property, while Mello-Roos taxes are equally and uniformly applied 
		to all properties.<br /><br />
		What are my Mello-Roos taxes paying for?<br /><br />
		Your taxes may be paying for both services and facilities. The services 
		may be financed only to the extent of new growth, and services include: 
		Police protection, fire protection, ambulance and paramedic services, 
		recreation program services, library services, the operation and 
		maintenance of parks, parkways and open space, museums, cultural 
		facilities, flood and storm protection, and services for the removal of 
		any threatening hazardous substance. Facilities which may be financed 
		under the Act include: Property with an estimated useful life of five 
		years or longer, parks, recreation facilities, parkway facilities, 
		open-space facilities, elementary and secondary school sites and 
		structures, libraries, child care facilities, natural gas pipeline 
		facilities, telephone lines, facilities to transmit and distribute 
		electrical energy, cable television lines, and others.<br /><br />
		When do I pay these taxes?<br /><br />
		By purchasing an interest in a subdivision within a Community Facilities 
		District you can expect to be assessed for a Mello-Roos tax which will 
		typically be collected with your general property tax bill. These 
		special tax payments are subject to the same penalties that apply to 
		regular property taxes.<br /><br />
		How long does the tax stay in effect?<br /><br />
		The tax will stay in effect until the principal and interest on the 
		bonds are paid off along with any reasonable administrative costs 
		incurred in collecting the special tax or so long as it is needed to pay 
		the expenses of services, but in no case shall exceed 40 years.<br /><br />
		What happens if a general tax payment is not made on time?<br /><br />
		Because the Mello-Roos tax is typically collected with your general 
		property tax bill, the Facilities District that obtained the lien may 
		withdraw the assessment from the tax roll and commence judicial 
		foreclosure.<br /><br />
		What is the basis for the tax?<br /><br />
		Most special taxes levied on properties within these districts have been 
		structured on the basis of density of development, square footage of 
		construction, or flat acreage charges. The act, however, allows for 
		considerable flexibility in the method of apportionment of taxes, and 
		the local agencies may have established an entirely different method of 
		levying the special tax against property in the district in question.<br /><br />
		How much will the Mello-Roos payment be?<br /><br />
		The amount of tax may vary from year-to-year, but may not exceed the 
		maximum amount specified when the district was created. In the case of 
		the purchase of a new house within a subdivision, the maximum amount of 
		the tax will be specified in the public report. The Resolution of 
		Formation must specify the rate, method of apportionment, and manner of 
		collection of the special tax in sufficient detail to allow each 
		landowner or resident within the proposed district to estimate the 
		maximum amount that he or she will have to pay.<br /><br />
		How is the special tax reflected on the real property records?<br /><br />
		The special tax is a lien on your property, essentially like a regular 
		tax lien. The lien is recorded as a “Notice of Special Tax Lien” which 
		is a continuing lien to secure each levy of the special tax.<br /><br />
		How are Mello-Roos taxes affected when the property is sold?<br /><br />
		The Mello-Roos tax is assessed against the land, but is not based upon 
		the value of the property, therefore, the possible increased value of 
		the property does not affect the amount of the tax when property is 
		sold. The amount of the tax may not exceed the original maximum amount 
		stated in the Resolution of Formation. Any delinquent payments must be 
		satisfied before the sale of the real property since the unpaid amounts 
		are a lien against the property.<br /><br />
