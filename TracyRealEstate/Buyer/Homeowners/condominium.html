		<div id="h2">Condominium and PUD Ownership</div><br />
		Builders, in an effort to combat the dual problem of an increasing 
		population and a declining availability of prime land, are increasingly 
		turning to common interest developments (CIDs) as a means to maximize 
		land use and offer homebuyers convenient, affordable housing.<br /><br />

		The two most common forms of common interest developments in many states 
		are Condominiums and Planned Unit Developments, often referred to as 
		PUDs. The essential characteristics shared by these two forms of 
		ownership are:
		
		<ol><li>Common ownership of private residential property</li>
		
		<li>Mandatory membership of all owners in an association which controls use 
		of the common property</li>
		
		<li>Governing documents which establish the procedures for governing the 
		association, the rules which the owners must follow in the use of their 
		individual lots or units as well as the common properties</li>
		
		<li>A means by which owners are assessed to finance the operation of the 
		association and maintenance of the common properties</li></ol>
		
		Before continuing further, it may be helpful to clarify a common 
		misconception about Condominiums and PUDs. The terms Condominium and PUD 
		refer to types of interests in land, not to physical styles of 
		dwellings. Therefore, when homebuyers say that they are buying a 
		townhouse, it is not the same as saying that they are buying a 
		condominium. When homebuyers say that they are buying a unit in a PUD, 
		they are not necessarily buying a single-family detached home. A 
		townhouse might legally be a condominium, a unit or lot in a Planned 
		Unit Development, or a single-family detached residence. The terms 
		Condominium or PUD will say a great deal about the ownership rights the 
		buyer will receive in the unit and the interest they will acquire in the 
		common properties or common areas of the development.<br /><br />

		Common interest developments offer many advantages to homebuyers, such 
		as low maintenance and access to attractive amenities. However, there 
		are restrictions and duties which come with ownership of a Condominium 
		or PUD that buyers should be aware of prior to purchase.<br /><br />

		To acquaint you with various aspects of ownership in common interest 
		developments, the Land Title Association has answered some of the 
		questions most commonly asked about Condominiums and PUDs.<br /><br />

		What are the basic differences between ownership of a Condominium and 
		ownership of a PUD?<br /><br />

		The owner(s) of a unit within a typical Condominium project owns 100% of 
		the unit, as defined by a recorded Condominium Plan. As well, they will 
		own a fractional or percentage interest in all common areas of the 
		Condominium project.<br /><br />

		The owner(s) of a lot within a PUD owns the lot which has been conveyed 
		to them-as shown in the recorded Tract Map or Parcel Map-and the 
		structure and improvements thereon. In addition, they receive rights and 
		easements to use in common areas owned by another-frequently a 
		Homeowner’s association-of which the individual lot owners are members.<br /><br />

		The above are basic descriptions and should not be considered legal 
		definitions.<br /><br />

		Besides ownership of my unit, what other amenities (common areas) will I 
		be acquiring use of and how will I own them?<br /><br />

		Common interest areas may span the spectrum from the ordinary-buildings, 
		roadways, walkways and utility rooms-to the extravagant-equestrian 
		trails and golf courses-with more usual amenities including community 
		swimming pools and clubhouse facilities.<br /><br />

		Your ownership rights in common areas will be spelled out in your 
		project’s Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC and 
		R’s). The subject of CC and R’s will be expanded upon later in this 
		brochure.<br /><br />

		As we stated in the answer to the previous question, Condominium owners 
		own a fractional or percentage interest in common with all other owners 
		in the Condominium project, in all common areas. PUD owners receive 
		rights and easements to use of common areas through their membership in 
		a Homeowner’s association, which typically owns and controls the common 
		areas. Some PUD projects, however, provide that the individual 
		homeowners will own a fractional interest in the common areas. Again, in 
		this case, a Homeowner’s association will have the right to regulate the 
		use of the common areas and to assess for purposes of maintaining the 
		common areas.<br /><br />

		Check your CC and R’s and association Bylaws (basically, rules governing 
		the management of the development) to insure that you understand your 
		rights to use of your unit and common areas.<br /><br />

		What services will my Homeowner’s assessments help to finance?<br /><br />

		Your Homeowner’s assessments support not only the easily 
		recognizable-building and swimming pool upkeep, landscape 
		maintenance-but also the unseen-association management and legal fees 
		and association insurance.<br /><br />

		As well, reserves must be factored into your assessments, including 
		reserves for replacement of such items as roadways and walkways. In the 
		case of condominiums, where ownership is usually limited to airspace 
		within the walls, floors and ceiling of the unit, reserves will 
		frequently fund replacement of such items as roofs and plumbing.<br /><br />

		Each member of the Homeowner’s association, upon purchasing their unit, 
		must receive a pro forma operating budget from the association. 
		Basically, this will be a financial statement of the income and 
		obligations of the association, which must include an estimate of the 
		life of the obligations covered under the assessments and how their 
		replacement is being funded.<br /><br />

		What happens if I fail to pay my Homeowner’s assessments?<br /><br />

		Delinquency fees will be added onto the unpaid assessments.<br /><br />

		Should your delinquency continue, the association has the right to place 
		a lien upon your property. The lien may lead to a foreclosure if the 
		delinquency is not paid.<br /><br />

		Of what importance are CC and R’s and Bylaws?<br /><br />

		CC and R’s and Bylaws are the rules and regulations of the community, 
		meant to guide the use of individual properties and common areas. Buyers 
		should be aware that CC and R’s and Bylaws may be written so as to 
		restrict not only property use, but also to restrict owners’ lifestyles, 
		for instance, spelling out hours during which entertainment, such as 
		parties, may be hosted.<br /><br />

		CC and R’s and Bylaws are highly important and should be thoroughly 
		examined and understood prior to purchase. They bind all owners and 
		their successors to the rules and regulations of the community. Failure 
		to follow those rules and regulations can be considered a breach of 
		contract. Legal action may be taken against the homeowner for any such 
		breach.<br /><br />

		At what point in the real estate transaction will I be allowed to review 
		a copy of my CC and R’s and Bylaws?<br /><br />

		Legally, it is the responsibility of the owner to provide the 
		prospective purchaser with the governing documents of the development 
		(CC and R’s and Bylaws), the most recent financial statement of the 
		Homeowner’s association and notice of any dues delinquent on the unit.<br /><br />

		The law states that these items should be delivered as soon as 
		practicable; however, the prospective buyer should request to see them 
		as early as possible. If you do not fully understand what is stated in 
		these documents, consult a real property attorney.<br /><br />

		Should I object to items included in the CC and R’s and/or Bylaws, will 
		I have the opportunity to terminate those items prior to taking 
		ownership?<br /><br />

		No. The process required to terminate these restrictions is often 
		complex and costly. Termination of restrictions will require, at least, 
		a majority vote by members of the Homeowner’s association, and may 
		require litigation.<br /><br />

		What if I have further questions regarding Condominium and PUD 
		ownership?<br /><br />

		Ask any questions you may have before you buy! Don’t wait to take 
		ownership to find out about restrictions and regulations affecting your 
		Homeownership rights.
