		<div id="h3">Closing and Title Costs</div><br />
		It’s the big day.<br /><br />

		The day you go to the title or escrow company, sign your name on the 
		dotted line, hand over a check and prepare to take ownership of your new 
		home.<br /><br />

		It’s also the day that you and the seller will pay “closing” or 
		settlement costs, an accumulation of separate charges paid to different 
		entities for the professional services associated with the buying and 
		selling of real property.<br /><br />

		It’s too often a day filled with uncertainty and stress.<br /><br />

		To help you better understand this confusing subject, the Land Title 
		Association has answered some of the questions most commonly asked about 
		title, closing and closing costs.<br /><br />

		<div id="h4">What services will I be paying for when I pay closing costs?</div><br />
	
		You will usually be paying for such things as real estate commissions, 
		appraisal fees, loan fees, escrow charges, advance payments such as 
		property taxes and homeowner’s insurance, title insurance premiums, pest 
		inspections and the like.<br /><br />

		<div id="h5">How much should I expect to pay in closing costs?</div><br />
		
		The amount you pay for closing costs will vary; however, when buying 
		your home and obtaining a new loan, an estimate of your closing costs 
		will be provided to you pursuant to the Real Estate Settlement 
		Procedures Act after you submit your loan application. This disclosure 
		provides you with a good faith estimate of what your closing costs will 
		be in the real estate process. An itemized list of charges will be 
		prepared when you close your transaction and take title to your new 
		property.<br /><br />

		<div id="h6">Can I pay for my closing costs in installments?</div><br />
	
		No, and it is easy to understand why. Many different parties will have 
		fulfilled their responsibilities and be awaiting payment upon closing. 
		The title or escrow company will disburse money to those parties, 
		pursuant to the escrow instructions, when funds are available.<br /><br />

		<div id="h7">Will I be allowed to write a personal check to cover my closing cost?</div>
		<br />
		Your closing funds should be in the form of a cashier’s check, issued by 
		an institution from the state of your purchase, made payable to the 
		title company or escrow office in the amount requested. A personal check 
		may delay the closing or may be unacceptable to the title or escrow 
		company. An out-of-state check could also cause a delay in your closing 
		due to possible delays in clearing the check.<br /><br />

		<div id="h8">How much can I expect to pay for Title Insurance?</div><br />
		
		This point is often misunderstood. Although the title company or escrow 
		office usually serves as a meeting ground for closing the sale, only a 
		small percentage of total closing fees are actually for title insurance 
		protection.<br /><br />

		Your title insurance premium may actually amount to less than one 
		percent of the purchase price of your home, and less than ten percent of 
		your total closing costs. The title policy is good for as long as you 
		and your heirs own the property with the payment of only one premium.<br /><br />

		<div id="h9" >Why are separate owner’s and lender’s title insurance policies issued?</div><br />
		
		Both you and your lender will want the security offered by title 
		insurance.<br /><br />

		Your home is an important purchase, and you will want to be certain your 
		home is yours, all yours. Title insurance companies insure your rights 
		and interests in order to protect you against claims.<br /><br />

		Your lender is looking to insure the enforceability of their lien on 
		your property and marketability. What is meant by “marketability”? Local 
		lenders will originate a loan here, and, often, sell it to an 
		out-of-state investor. This investor, who may never see the property, 
		needs to know that he has a valid and enforceable lien. Title insurance 
		is the way of making certain. Without a current title policy, the loan 
		is essentially unmarketable.<br /><br />

		<div id="h10">What does my Title dollar pay for?</div><br />
		
		Title insurers, unlike property or casualty insurance companies, operate 
		under the theory of risk elimination.<br /><br />

		Risk elimination can only be accomplished after an intensive period of 
		risk identification.<br /><br />

		Title companies spend a high percentage of their operating revenue each 
		year collecting, storing, maintaining and analyzing official records for 
		information that affects title to real property. The issuance of a title 
		insurance policy is highly labor-intensive. It is based upon the 
		maintenance of a title “plant” or library of title records, in many 
		cases dating back over a hundred years. Each day, recorded documents 
		affecting real property are posted to these plants so that when a title 
		search on a particular parcel is requested, the information is already 
		organized for rapid and accurate retrieval.<br /><br />

		Trained title experts are able, with the aid of their extensive title 
		plants, to identify the rights others may have in your property, such as 
		recorded liens, legal actions, disputed interests, rights of way or 
		other encumbrances on your title. Before closing your transaction, you 
		can seek to clear those encumbrances which you do not wish to assume.<br /><br />

		The goal of title companies is to conduct such a thorough search and 
		evaluation of public records that no claims will ever arise. Of course, 
		this is impossible--we live in an imperfect world, where human error and 
		changing legal interpretations make 100 percent risk elimination 
		impossible. When claims do arise, title insurance companies have 
		professional claims personnel to make sure that your property rights are 
		protected pursuant to the terms of your policy.<br /><br />

		To conclude, when you pay for your title insurance policy, you are 
		paying for a team of professionals who have worked together to deliver 
		you a title insurance policy which represents protection for your 
		ownership of real property.<br /><br />

		<div id="h11">Who can I look for straight answers on Title, Closing, and closing 
		costs?</div><br />
		<br />
		Title or escrow company personnel are available to review and explain 
		your title policy and your closing statement.<br /><br />
