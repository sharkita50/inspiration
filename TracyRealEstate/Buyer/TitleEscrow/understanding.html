		<div id="h3">Understanding Preliminary Reports</div><br />
		After months of searching, you’ve finally found it -- your perfect dream 
		home. But is it perfect?<br /><br />

		Will you be purchasing more than just a beautiful home? Will you also be 
		acquiring liens placed on the property by prior owners? Have documents 
		been recorded that will restrict your use of the property?<br /><br />

		The preliminary report will provide you with the opportunity, prior to 
		purchase, to review matters affecting your property which will be 
		excluded from coverage under your title insurance policy unless removed 
		or eliminated before your purchase.<br /><br />

		To help you better understand this often bewildering subject, the Land 
		Title Association has answered some of the questions most commonly asked 
		about preliminary reports.<br /><br />

		<div id="h4">What is a Preliminary Report?</div><br />
		
		A preliminary report is a report prepared prior to issuing a policy of 
		title insurance that shows the ownership of a specific parcel of land, 
		together with the liens and encumbrances thereon which will not be 
		covered under a subsequent title insurance policy.<br /><br />
		<div id="h5">What role does a Preliminary Report play in the real estate process?</div><br />
		
		A preliminary report contains the conditions under which the title 
		company will issue a particular type of title insurance policy.<br /><br />
		The preliminary report lists, in advance of purchase, title defects, 
		liens and encumbrances which would be excluded from coverage if the 
		requested title insurance policy were to be issued as of the date of the 
		preliminary report. The report may then be reviewed and discussed by the 
		parties to a real estate transaction and their agents.<br /><br />

		Thus, a preliminary report provides the opportunity to seek the removal 
		of items referenced in the report which are objectionable to the buyer 
		prior to purchase.<br /><br />

		<div id="h6">When and how is the Preliminary Report produced?</div><br />
		
		Shortly after escrow is opened, an order will be placed with the title 
		company which will then begin the process involved in producing the 
		report.<br /><br />
		This process calls for the assembly and review of certain recorded 
		matters relative to both the property and the parties to the 
		transaction. Examples of recorded matters include a deed of trust 
		recorded against the property or a lien recorded against the buyer or 
		seller for an unpaid court award or unpaid taxes.<br /><br />

		These recorded matters are listed numerically as “exceptions” in the 
		preliminary report. They will remain exceptions from title insurance 
		coverage unless eliminated or released prior to the transfer of title.<br /><br />

		<div id="h7">What should I look for when reading my Preliminary Report?</div><br />
		
		You will be interested, primarily, in the extent of your ownership 
		rights. This means you will want to review the ownership interest in the 
		property you will be buying as well as any claims, restrictions or 
		interests of other people involving the property.<br /><br />
		The report will note in a statement of vesting the degree, quantity, 
		nature and extent of the owner’s interest in the real property. The most 
		common form of interest is “fee simple” or “fee” which is the highest 
		type of interest an owner can have in land.<br /><br />

		Liens, restrictions and interests of others which are being excluded 
		from coverage will be listed numerically as exceptions in the 
		preliminary report. These may be claims by creditors who have liens or 
		liens for payment of taxes or assessments. There may also be recorded 
		restrictions which have been placed in a prior deed or contained in what 
		are termed CC&amp;Rs- covenants, conditions and restrictions. Finally, 
		interests of third parties are not uncommon and may include easements 
		given by a prior owner which limit your use of the property. When you 
		buy property you may not wish to have these claims or restrictions on 
		your property. Instead, you may want to clear the unwanted items prior 
		to purchase.<br /><br />

		In addition to the limitations noted above, a printed list of standard 
		exceptions and exclusions listing items not covered by your title 
		insurance policy may be attached as an exhibit item to your report. 
		Unlike the numbered exclusions, which are specific to the property you 
		are buying, these are standard exceptions and exclusions appearing in 
		title insurance policies. The review of this section is important, as it 
		sets forth matters which will not be covered under your title insurance 
		policy, but which you may wish to investigate, such as governmental laws 
		or regulations governing building and zoning.<br /><br />

		<div id="h8">Will the Preliminary Report disclose the complete condition of the title 
		to a property?</div><br />
		
		No. It is important to note that the preliminary report is not a written 
		representation as to the condition of title and may not list all liens, 
		defects, and encumbrances affecting title to the land, but merely report 
		the current ownership and matters that the title company will exclude 
		from coverage if a title insurance policy should later be issued.<br /><br />
		<div id="h9">Is a Preliminary Report the same thing as title insurance?</div><br />
		
		Definitely not.<br /><br />
		A preliminary report is an offer to insure, it is not a report of a 
		complete history of recorded documents relating to the property. A 
		preliminary report is a statement of terms and conditions of the offer 
		to issue a title insurance policy, not a representation as to the 
		condition of title.<br /><br />

		These distinctions are important for the following reasons: first, no 
		contract or liability exists until the title insurance policy is issued; 
		second, the title insurance policy is issued to a particular insured 
		person and others cannot claim the benefit of the policy.<br /><br />

		<div id="h10">Can I be protected against title risks prior to the close of the real 
		estate transaction?</div><br />
		
		Yes, you can. Title companies can protect your interest through the 
		issuance of “binders” and “commitments”.<br /><br />
		A binder is an agreement to issue insurance giving temporary coverage 
		until such time as a formal policy is issued. A commitment is a title 
		insurer’s contractual obligation to insure title to real property once 
		its stated requirements have been met.<br /><br />

		Discuss with your title insurer the best means to protect your 
		interests.<br /><br />

		<div id="h11">How do I go about clearing unwanted liens and encumbrances?</div><br />
		
		You will wish to carefully review the preliminary report. Should the 
		title to the property be clouded, you and your agents will work with the 
		seller and the seller’s agents to clear the unwanted liens and 
		encumbrances prior to taking title.<br /><br />
		<div id="h12">Who can I turn to for further information regarding Preliminary Reports?</div><br />
		
		Your real estate agent and your attorney, should you choose to use one, 
		will help explain the preliminary report to you. Your escrow and title 
		company can also be helpful sources.<br /><br />
		<div id="h13">CONCLUSION</div><br />
		
		In a business which is directed at risk elimination, the efforts leading 
		to the production of the preliminary report, which is designed to 
		facilitate the issuance of a policy of title insurance, is perhaps the 
		most important function undertaken.<br /><br/>
