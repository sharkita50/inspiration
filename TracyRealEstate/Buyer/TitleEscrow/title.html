		<div id="h3">Understanding Title Insurance</div><br />
		What is title insurance? Newspapers refer to it in the weekly real 
		estate sections and you hear about it in conversations with real estate 
		brokers. If you’ve purchased a home you may be familiar with the 
		benefits of title insurance. However, if this is your first home, you 
		may wonder, “Why do I need yet another insurance policy?” While a number 
		of issues can be raised by that question, we will start with a general 
		answer.<br /><br />
		The purchase of a home is one of the most expensive and important 
		purchases you will ever make. You and your mortgage lender will want to 
		make sure the property is indeed yours and that no one else has any 
		lien, claim or encumbrance on your property.<br /><br />
		The Land Title Association, in the following pages, answers some 
		questions frequently asked about an often misunderstood line of 
		insurance - title insurance.<br /><br />
		<div id="h4">What is the difference between title insurance and casualty insurance?</div><br />
		
		Title insurers work to identify and eliminate risk before issuing a 
		title insurance policy. Casualty insurers assume risks.<br /><br />
		Casualty insurance companies realize that a certain number of losses 
		will occur each year in a given category (auto, fire, etc.). The 
		insurers collect premiums monthly or annually from the policy holders to 
		establish reserve funds in order to pay for expected losses.<br /><br />
		Title companies work in a very different manner. Title insurance will 
		indemnify you against loss under the terms of your policy, but title 
		companies work in advance of issuing your policy to identify and 
		eliminate potential risks and therefore prevent losses caused by title 
		defects that may have been created in the past.<br /><br />
		Title insurance also differs from casualty insurance in that the 
		greatest part of the title insurance premium dollar goes towards risk 
		elimination. Title companies maintain title plants, which contain 
		information regarding property transfers and liens reaching back many 
		years. Maintaining these title plants, along with the searching and 
		examining of title, is where most of your premium dollar goes.<br /><br />
		<div id="h5">Who needs title insurance?</div><br />
		
		Buyers and lenders in real estate transactions need title insurance. 
		Both want to know that the property they are involved with is insured 
		against certain title defects. Title companies provide this needed 
		insurance coverage subject to the terms of the policy. The seller, buyer 
		and lender all benefit from the insurance provided by title companies.<br /><br />
		<div id="h6">What does title insurance insure?</div><br />
		
		Title insurance offers protection against claims resulting from various 
		defects (as set out in the policy) which may exist in the title to a 
		specific parcel of real property, effective on the issue date of the 
		policy. For example, a person might claim to have a deed or lease giving 
		them ownership or the right to possess your property. Another person 
		could claim to hold an easement giving them a right of access across 
		your land. Yet another person may claim that they have a lien on your 
		property securing the repayment of a debt. That property may be an empty 
		lot or it may hold a 50-story office tower. Title companies work with 
		all types of real property.<br /><br />
		<div id="h7">What types of policies are available?</div><br />
		
		Title companies routinely issue two types of policies: An “owner’s 
		policy” which insures you, the Homebuyer, for as long as you and your 
		heirs own the home; and a “lender’s” policy which insures the priority 
		of the lender’s security interest over the claims that others may have 
		in the property.<br /><br />
		<div id="h8">What protection am I obtaining with my title policy?</div><br />
		
		A title insurance policy contains provisions for the payment of the 
		legal fees in defense of a claim against your property which is covered 
		under your policy. It also contains provisions for indemnification 
		against losses which result from a covered claim. A premium is paid at 
		the close of a transaction. There are no continuing premiums due, as 
		there are with other types of insurance.<br /><br />
		<div id="h9">What are my chances of ever using my title policy?</div><br />
		
		In essence, by acquiring your policy, you derive the important knowledge 
		that recorded matters have been searched and examined so that title 
		insurance covering your property can be issued. Because we are risk 
		eliminators, the probability of exercising your right to make a claim is 
		very low. However, claims against your property may not be valid, making 
		the continuous protection of the policy all the more important. When a 
		title company provides a legal defense against claims covered by your 
		title insurance policy, the savings to you for that legal defense alone 
		will greatly exceed the one-time premium.<br /><br />
		<div id="h10">What if I am buying property from someone I know?</div><br />
		
		You may not know the owner as well as you think you do. People undergo 
		changes in their personal lives that may affect title to their property. 
		People get divorced, change their wills, engage in transactions that 
		limit the use of the property and have liens and judgments placed 
		against them personally for various reasons.<br /><br />
		There may also be matters affecting the property that are not obvious or 
		known, even by the existing owner, which a title search and examination 
		seeks to uncover as part of the process leading up to the issuance of 
		the title insurance policy.<br /><br />
		Just as you wouldn’t make an investment based on a phone call, you 
		shouldn’t buy real property without assurances as to your title. Title 
		insurance provides these assurances.<br /><br />
		The process of risk identification and elimination performed by the 
		title companies, prior to the issuance of a title policy, benefits all 
		parties in the property transaction. It minimizes the chances that 
		adverse claims might be raised, and by doing so reduces the number of 
		claims that need to be defended or satisfied. This process keeps costs 
		and expenses down for the title company and maintains the traditional 
		low cost of title insurance.<br /><br />
